When Hubot sees you sign in, it will send you a picture.  When it's loaded in your chat client (if you're using Adium, you'll need to install the [Adinline](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=7926) plugin) Hubot is able to get your IP, and then open the security group(s) to you.\n\n# Installation\nAssuming you've installed [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) and have an instance already running, the steps are simple.  Just add \"hubot-aws-sesame\" to both your dependencies list in Hubot's package.json file as well as the external-scripts.json file.  Then run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n# Configuration:\n\n* HUBOT_AWS_REGION\n* HUBOT_AWS_KEY_ID\n* HUBOT_AWS_SECRET_KEY\n* HUBOT_AWS_SEC_RULES\n* HUBOT_ROOT_URL\n\n```HUBOT_AWS_SEC_RULES``` should contain the security group(s) that should have access enabled and the port range(s) that should be opened within them.  It should be of the form (spaces are ignored):\n\n<code>\n  &lt;sec group id&gt;: &lt;port start&gt;[ - &lt;port end&gt;][, &lt;port start&gt; - &lt;port end&gt;];\n</code>\n\nFor instance, each of the following would work:\n\n* sg-123: 22\n* sg-123: 20 - 222\n* sg-123: 22; sg-456: 1-1600\n* sg-123: 10 - 20; sg-456: 30\n\nHUBOT_ROOT_URL should be the root URL of an internet visible host.  This is necessary so that a message can be sent to the client containing a link to this bot's Hubot web server.  For instance, the following are valid values:\n\n* http://12.34.56.78\n* https://bothost.example.com\n* http://12.34.56.78:123\n\n# Commands:\n\n    hubot show firewall - Show all users who currently have access to AWS\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bmuller","email":"bamuller@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-24T16:19:06.937Z","created":"2014-08-19T21:32:27.978Z","0.0.0":"2014-08-19T21:32:27.978Z","0.0.1":"2014-08-24T16:19:06.937Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bmuller/hubot-aws-sesame","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","aws"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/bmuller/hubot-aws-sesame.git"},"author":{"name":"Brian Muller","email":"bamuller@gmail.com","url":"http://findingscience.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bmuller/hubot-aws-sesame/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
