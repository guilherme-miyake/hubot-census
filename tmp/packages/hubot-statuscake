For instance, the contents of my `external-scripts.json` looks like:\n```json\n[\"hubot-statuscake\"]\n```\n\n## Configuration on Hubot's Server\n\nThere are three environment variables: `STATUSCAKE_MESSAGE`, `STATUSCAKE_ROOM`, and `STATUSCAKE_TOKEN`.\n\n`STATUSCAKE_MESSAGE` is the message that will be sent to your room. It is a Mustache string. The following variables are available to you: `name`, `url`, `status`, `statuscode`, `ip`, `token`.\nRead https://github.com/janl/mustache.js for more details.\n\nImportant note: HTML entities are encoded by Mustache by default, so if you don't want that, use `{{&somevar}}` instead of `{{somevar}}`.\n\n`STATUSCAKE_ROOM` is the name of the room in which you want to send your statuses. Default is `statuscake`.\n\n`STATUSCAKE_TOKEN` is your user token. It is the MD5 sum of your username appended to your API key. This *must* be set. Otherwise, no messages will be sent. Default is an empty string.\n\n## Configuration on StatusCake\n\n`hubot-statuscake` reponds to a POST request sent from StatusCake using their Ping URL mechanism. `hubot-statuscake` checks for a POST request on the `/statuscake` route.\n\nTo configure StatusCake, in a new or existing contact group, you will need to add the Ping URL that `hubot-statuscake` will be responding to.\n\nTo determine your Ping URL: If your Hubot is being hosted at `http://www.thisismyhubot.com`, the Ping URL you would use would be `http://www.thisismyhubot.com/statuscake` \n\nAfter you enter your Ping URL, save the contact group. StatusCake will now be sending requests to your Hubot.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the test suite, you can checkout the repository and run `npm test`.\n\nYou can also run the test suite if the package is installed by running `npm test hubot-statuscake`.\n\n## License\n\nLicense is MIT. See `LICENSE` for more details.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"seabre","email":"sean@saidigital.co"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-06-18T23:52:23.686Z","created":"2014-03-29T22:50:08.077Z","0.0.1":"2014-03-29T22:50:08.077Z","0.0.2":"2014-03-29T23:09:29.211Z","0.0.3":"2014-06-18T23:42:10.556Z","0.0.4":"2014-06-18T23:52:23.686Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-statuscake","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","statuscake"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-statuscake.git"},"author":{"name":"Sean Brewer","email":"seabre986@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-statuscake/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
