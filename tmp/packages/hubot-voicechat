Using this script you can integrate audio conferencing into your own chatting apps like Campfire, Hipchat or Flowdock among many others. The room will last for the next 24 hours. Learn more on [Voice Chat API](http://VoiceChatAPI.com).\n\n\n## Configuration & Commands\nHUBOT_VOICECHAT_HOST - (optional) The base URL of a self-hosted instance of the Voice Chat API.\nHUBOT_VOICECHAT_EXPIRE_CONFERENCE - (optional) True if conference is set to expire after 24 hours since its creation.\n\nhubot conference - create an audio conference room.\nhubot voicechat - create an audio conference room. (whichever you prefer)\n\n\n## Setting up\n\nYou will need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Joyent has\nan [excellent blog post on how to get those installed](http://joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm), so we'll omit those details here.\n\nOnce node and npm are ready, we can install hubot and coffeescript:\n\n    % npm install -g hubot coffee-script\n\nThis will give us the `hubot` command, which is used for running a hubot, and more importantly now, generating your own hubot. The name of the new bot is\nthe last argument, and will be created in the directory of the same name. For\nexample, to create a new bot named myhubot:\n\n    % hubot --create myhubot\n\nIf you are using git, the generated directory includes a .gitignore, so you can\ninitialize and add everything:\n\n    % cd myhubot\n    % git init\n    % git add .\n    % git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\nYou now have your own functional hubot! There's a `bin/hubot`\ncommand for convenience, to handle installing npm dependencies, loading scripts,\nand then launching your hubot.\n\n    % bin/hubot\n    Hubot>\n\nThis starts hubot using the [shell adapter](adapters/shell.md), which\nis mostly useful for development. Make note of  `Hubot>`; this is the name he'll\n`respond` to with commands. For example, to list available commands:\n\n    % bin/hubot\n    Hubot> hubot: help\n    hubot <keyword> tweet - Returns a link to a tweet about <keyword>\n    hubot <user> is a badass guitarist - assign a role to a user\n    hubot <user> is not a badass guitarist - remove a role from a user\n    hubot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few parameters to try to return an animated GIF instead.\n    hubot convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.\n    hubot die - End hubot process\n    hubot echo <text> - Reply back with <text>\n    hubot fake event <event> - Triggers the <event> event for debugging reasons\n    hubot help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.\n    hubot help <query> - Displays all help commands that match <query>.\n    hubot image me <query> - The Original. Queries Google Images for <query> and returns a random top result.\n    hubot map me <query> - Returns a map view of the area returned by `query`.\n    hubot math me <expression> - Calculate the given expression.\n    hubot mustache me <query> - Searches Google Images for the specified query and mustaches it.\n    hubot mustache me <url> - Adds a mustache to the specified URL.\n    hubot ping - Reply with pong\n    hubot show storage - Display the contents that are persisted in the brain\n    hubot show users - Display all users that hubot knows about\n    hubot the rules - Make sure hubot still knows the rules.\n    hubot time - Reply with current time\n    hubot translate me <phrase> - Searches for a translation for the <phrase> and then prints that bad boy out.\n    hubot translate me from <source> into <target> <phrase> - Translates <phrase> from <source> into <target>. Both <source> and <target> are optional\n    hubot who is <user> - see what roles a user has\n    hubot youtube me <query> - Searches YouTube for the query and returns the video embed link.\n    hubot pug bomb N - get N pugs\n    hubot pug me - Receive a pug\n    hubot ship it - Display a motivation squirrel\n\nYou almost definitely will want to change his name to give him some more character. bin/hubot takes a `--name`:\n\n    % bin/hubot --name myhubot\n    myhubot>\n\nYour hubot will now respond as `myhubot`. This is\ncase-insensitive, and can be prefixed with `@` or suffixed with `:`. These are equivalent:\n\n    MYHUBOT help\n    myhubot help\n    @myhubot help\n    myhubot: help\n\n## Deploying\n\nYou can deploy hubot to Heroku, which is the officially supported method.\nAdditionally you are able to deploy hubot to a UNIX-like system or Windows.\nPlease note the support for deploying to Windows isn't officially supported.\n\n* [Deploying Hubot onto Heroku](deploying/heroku.md)\n* [Deploying Hubot onto UNIX](deploying/unix.md)\n* [Deploying Hubot onto Windows](deploying/windows.md)","maintainers":[{"name":"dhllee424","email":"dhllee424@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-02-11T04:11:55.132Z","created":"2014-02-11T04:07:38.780Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-11T04:07:38.780Z","1.0.1":"2014-02-11T04:11:55.132Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"abdulsalito":true}}
