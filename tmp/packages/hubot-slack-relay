Hubot Slack Relay\r\n\r\nA script to relay messages from a local channel to a remote channel on a separate slack server without an account. This script is designed\r\nspecifically for use with Hubot and the Slack adapter.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Multiple local channels can relay to multiple remote channels\r\n* No need for additional bots\r\n* Accounts not required on each slack server\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n`npm install hubot-slack-relay`\r\n\r\nThen add `\"hubot-slack-relay\"` to `external-scripts.json`\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\n### Adding Relays\r\n\r\nAdds a relay from the local channel to the remote channel. The remote token will be the same token as the remote HUBOT\\_SLACK_TOKEN.\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* Tokens are private and this should be setup via Direct Messaging.\r\n\r\n`hubot relay add <local-channel> <remote-channel> <remote-token>`\r\n\r\n### Remove Relays\r\n\r\nRemoves relays from the local channel specified. All remote channels can be removed or single remote channels can be removed one by one.\r\n\r\n`hubot relay remove <local-channel> [<remote-channel>]`\r\n\r\n### List Relays\r\n\r\nShow all existing local server to remote server relay mappings and a partial token listing in case of duplicates.\r\n\r\n`hubot relay list`\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nIf you're using the [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth/) script, you can get the user IDs required for the `HUBOT_AUTH_ADMIN` setting by calling the [users.list API method](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list/test).\r\n\r\nUsers can be part of the admin group or a custom group named `relay` can be created.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"davidkassa","email":"david.kassa@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-10T03:30:25.312Z","created":"2015-04-28T03:35:04.307Z","0.0.1":"2015-04-28T03:35:04.307Z","0.0.2":"2015-04-28T03:42:38.317Z","0.0.3":"2015-04-28T03:51:52.192Z","0.0.4":"2015-04-28T04:22:56.775Z","0.0.5":"2015-04-29T14:29:17.423Z","0.0.6":"2015-04-29T14:39:54.348Z","0.0.7":"2015-04-29T14:57:01.096Z","0.0.8":"2015-04-29T14:59:51.788Z","0.0.9":"2015-04-30T19:51:18.746Z","0.0.10":"2015-05-12T04:38:07.152Z","0.0.11":"2015-06-23T13:39:23.601Z","0.0.12":"2015-06-25T15:25:02.728Z","0.0.13":"2015-07-10T03:30:25.312Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/davidkassa/hubot-slack-relay","keywords":["hubot","slack","hubot-scripts","ingress","relay"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/davidkassa/hubot-slack-relay.git"},"author":{"name":"David Kassa","url":"https://github.com/davidkassa"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/davidkassa/hubot-slack-relay/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","description":"Hubot script to relay messages between Slack servers.","users":{"nosybore":true}}
