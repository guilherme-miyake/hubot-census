You will need to sign an agreement with B-cycle to use the API. To get started, use the website's [contact form](https://www.bcycle.com/contact-us). They are really nice over there.\n\nYou will receive an API key as well as a PDF document outlining how to use the API as soon as you've returned the agreement.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn your hubot repository, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-bcycle-finder --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-bcycle-finder** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-bcycle-finder\"]\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe script has tree environment variables.\n\n- `BCYCLE_API_KEY` is the one provided at registration\n- `BCYCLE_PROGRAM_ID` is an integer that corresponds with your city.\n - You can retrieve an up-to-date program list by using `hubot bcycle programs`\n- `BCYCLE_DEFAULT_STATIONS` is a comma separated list of integers of your preferred stations\n - You can retrieve the station IDs by using `hubot bcycle search <some query>` \n\n### Heroku\n\n```bash\nheroku config:set BCYCLE_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEYHERE\nheroku config:set BCYCLE_PROGRAM_ID=64\nheroku config:set BCYCLE_DEFAULT_STATIONS=2171,2173\n```\n\n### Standard\n\n```\nexport BCYCLE_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEYHERE\nexport BCYCLE_PROGRAM_ID=64\nexport BCYCLE_DEFAULT_STATIONS=2171,2173\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### `hubot bcycle`\n\nReturns the status of the default stations, if any.\n\n```\nuser> hubot bcycle\nhubot> #2171 - Music Row Roundabout: 16th Ave S (B card only)\nhubot> > Active: Bikes: 8 | Docks: 3 | Total: 11\nhubot> #2173 - Frist Center: 9th Ave S & Demonbreun St\nhubot> > Active: Bikes: 6 | Docks: 5 | Total: 11\n```\n\n### `hubot bcycle list`\n\nGet a listing of stations in the configured program. _Note: This will likely flood your chat room. Consider using `hubot bcycle search` instead._\n\n```\nuser> hubot bcycle list\nhubot> #2162 - The District: Commerce & 2nd Ave N\nhubot> #2164 - North Capitol: 4th Ave N & James Robertson Pkwy (Check outs By B-card only)\nhubot> #2165 - Fifth Third Plaza: Church St between 4th & 5th Ave N\nhubot> #2166 - Public Square: 3rd Ave N & Union St\nhubot> #2168 - Cumberland Park: Victory Way at Base of Pedestrian St Bridge\nhubot> #2169 - TPAC: 6th Ave N & Union St\nhubot> #2170 - The Gulch: 11th Ave S & 12th Ave S\nhubot> #2171 - Music Row Roundabout: 16th Ave S (B card only)\nhubot> #2172 - Centennial Park: 27th Ave N\nhubot> #2173 - Frist Center: 9th Ave S & Demonbreun St\nhubot> #2174 - Fisk/Meharry: Jefferson St & Dr. D.B.
