By\nadding an emoji reaction to messages, those messages are\nscanned for URLs, then the URLs are pushed into the reading\nlist.  Then, either weekly or daily, the bot will post the\nreading list to the channel.\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Fmf4wDY.png)\n\n## installation\n\nThis is a plugin for [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) that\nalso relies on [hubot-slack](https://slackapi.github.io/hubot-slack/).\nTo install in your Hubot project, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hubot-slack-reading-list --save\n```\n\nThis will warn you if you don't already have an acceptable\nversion of Hubot or hubot-slack installed.  Then, add the\nscript to your Hubot's `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"...\",\n  \"hubot-slack-reading-list\",\n  \"...\"\n]\n```\n\nThen just startup your Hubot.  No environment variables\nor anything else required!\n\n## usage\n\nThe script only responds to one command, but that\ncommand is flexible.  Here's the basic usage:\n\n```\n@bot [daily or weekly] reading list [emoji] <name>\n```\n\nThe parts of the message in square brackets are optional.\nHere is a breakdown of the parts and how they influence\nthe script's behavior:\n\n| @bot | daily or weekly | reading list | emoji | name |\n|:-----|:----------------|:-------------|:------|:-----|\n| The script requires that the bot be messaged directly in a room that it's in. | The script can either post the reading list daily or weekly. If neither is specified it defaults to weekly. *Daily* reports occur every weekday at 4:00 PM. *Weekly* reports occur every Friday at 4:00 PM. | This is required to trigger the script. | You can specify what emoji reaction marks a message for the reading list.  If you don't specify one, it defaults to `:book:`. | This is the name of the reading list.  It's not particularly useful, but it's used as the title of the reading list post. |\n\nYou can add multiple channels to the same reading list by\nissuing the `reading-list` command again, but you can use\nonly the required parts to do that:\n\n```\n@bot reading list <name>\n```\n\nThe reading list will only be reported in the channel\nit was originally created in.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mgwalker","email":"npm@darkcooger.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-23T22:18:28.655Z","created":"2017-02-10T22:06:54.021Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-10T22:06:54.021Z","1.0.1":"2017-02-22T19:21:43.122Z","1.0.2":"2017-02-23T22:18:28.655Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mgwalker/hubot-slack-reading-list#readme","keywords":["hubot","slack","reading","list","reaction","emoji"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/mgwalker/hubot-slack-reading-list.git"},"author":{"name":"Greg Walker","email":"hubot-slack-reading-list@darkcooger.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mgwalker/hubot-slack-reading-list/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
