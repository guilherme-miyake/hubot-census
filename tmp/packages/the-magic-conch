The magic conch\n\nAll hail the magic conch.\n\n![Woo loo loo](./img/magic_conch.gif)\n\n## Quickstart\n\nTo bring the magic conch into your life, simply perform the following commands.\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nThe magic conch, once addressed, will respond to any question.\n\n> hubot can I have something to eat?  \n\\> Try asking again.\n\n\n> hubot can I have something to eat?  \n\\> No.\n\n\nThe magic conch will also recognize any who identify themselves as club members.\n> All hail the magic conch!  \n\\> Woo loo loo loo!\n\n## Project\n\nBecaues ES6 is the new hotness, I didn't settle for writing coffeescript, or ES5, \nlike some kind of dirty peasant. And I added a plethora of new features to boot! \nThings like cleaning, linting, and transpiling! Oh boy!\n\nShould you want to make the conch more robust, edit `src/conch.js` as you see fit. \nWhen you're done, run `npm start` in your terminal to clean, lint, transpile and test.\n\nIn all seriousness, this was just a fun little exercise in learning about github's \nhubot. \n\nThe inspiration for this particular toy came from spongebob squarepants. Namely, the \n\"Club Spongebob\" episode from season three. All conch responses were taken from the \n[spongebob wikia](http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob).\n\n## Questions\n\nPretty straightforward little toy. Feel free to email me with any questions.\n\nIf you want to make one of your own, see github's hubot page at \n[https://hubot.github.com/](https://hubot.github.com/).\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"smelnicki","email":"smelnicki3@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-08-28T20:51:43.796Z","created":"2015-08-27T23:46:38.245Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-27T23:46:38.245Z","1.0.1":"2015-08-28T03:51:53.225Z","1.0.2":"2015-08-28T20:28:27.899Z","1.0.3":"2015-08-28T20:33:13.321Z","1.0.4":"2015-08-28T20:51:43.796Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/smelnicki/magic-conch","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","magic","conch","magic-conch"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/smelnicki/magic-conch.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Melnicki","email":"smelnicki3@gmail.com","url":"http://smelnicki.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/smelnicki/magic-conch/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
