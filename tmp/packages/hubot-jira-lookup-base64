It's usable in cases like: your JIRA instance is behind company firewall and Hubot instance it's outside. Or you just want such kind of behaviour. To enable this mode just set `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_SIMPLE=true`. Please note, that due to the lack of real conection to the JIRA it won't check if issue really exists.\n\nIn other case - there are three configuration values required for full jira-lookup to work properly.\n\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_USERNAME`\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_PASSWORD`\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_BASE64`\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_URL`\n\nThere are also optional configuration values.\n\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_INC_DESC` - allows you to include 'Y' or exclude 'N' the description field from the jira report. (default to 'Y')\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_MAX_DESC_LEN` - allows you to display only the first 'x' characters from the description field\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_IGNORE_USERS` - allows you to ignore messages from pre-defined users. Default is to ignore from users named \"jira\" and \"github\", casing is ignored.\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT` - allows you to set the time, in minutes, between mentions of a specific ticket in a specific channel/room. Defaults to 15 minutes\n* `HUBOT_SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK` - allows you to output responses formatted as [Slack Attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jinglemansweep","email":"jinglemansweep@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-03-18T11:40:09.479Z","created":"2016-03-18T11:34:49.776Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-18T11:34:49.776Z","0.0.2":"2016-03-18T11:40:09.479Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jinglemansweep/hubot-jira-lookup-base64#readme","keywords":["hubot","jira"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jinglemansweep/hubot-jira-lookup-base64.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"JingleManSweep","email":"jinglemansweep@gmail.com"}],"author":{"name":"JingleManSweep","email":"jinglemansweep@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jinglemansweep/hubot-jira-lookup-base64/issues"},"license":"Apache 2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
