infrastructure\nautomation platform.\n\n## Installing and configuring the plugin\n\nTo install and configure the plugin, first install hubot by following the\ninstallation instructions at https://hubot.github.com/docs/.\n\nAfter you have installed hubot and generated your bot, go to your bot directory\nand install the plugin npm package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hubot-stackstorm\n```\n\nAfter that, edit the `external-scripts.json` file in your bot directory and\nmake sure it contains ``hubot-stackstorm`` entry.\n\n```json\n[\n  ...\n  \"hubot-stackstorm\"\n]\n```\n\nFinal file should look something like that:\n\n```json\n\n[\n  \"hubot-diagnostics\",\n  \"hubot-help\",\n  \"hubot-heroku-keepalive\",\n  \"hubot-google-images\",\n  \"hubot-google-translate\",\n  \"hubot-pugme\",\n  \"hubot-maps\",\n  \"hubot-redis-brain\",\n  \"hubot-rules\",\n  \"hubot-shipit\",\n  \"hubot-youtube\",\n  \"hubot-stackstorm\"\n]\n```\n\nIf you want to use this plugin with a Slack adapter, you also need to install\n`hubot-slack` npm package.\n\n```bash\nnpm install hubot-slack\n```\n\nAfter that's done, you are ready to start your bot.\n\n## Plugin environment variable options\n\nTo configure the plugin behavior, the following environment variable can be\nspecified when running hubot:\n\n* `ST2_API` - URL to the StackStorm API endpoint.\n* `ST2_WEBUI_URL` - Base URL to the WebUI. If provided, link to the execution\n  history will be provided in the chat after every execution (optional).\n* `ST2_AUTH_USERNAME` - API credentials - username (optional).\n* `ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD` - API credentials - password (optional).\n* `ST2_AUTH_URL` - URL to the StackStorm Auth API (optional).\n* `ST2_COMMANDS_RELOAD_INTERVAL` - How often the list of available commands\n  should be reloaded. Defaults to every 120 seconds (optional).\n* `ST2_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH` - Message truncation to preserve chat context. Default is 500 characters of length. 0 means no limit (optional).\n* `ST2_SLACK_SUCCESS_COLOR` - Slack attachement color for success, can either be one of good, warning, danger, or any hex color code (optional).\n* `ST2_SLACK_FAIL_COLOR` - Slack attachement color for failures either be one of good, warning, danger, or any hex color code (optional).\n\nNote: ``ST2_ROUTE`` environment variable mentioned below should only be\nspecified if you modified the rule which comes with a ``hubot`` pack to use a\nnon default value of ``hubot`` for the ``trigger.route`` criteria.\n\n* `ST2_ROUTE` - StackStorm notification channel where all the notification messages\n  should be sent to. This is the reference to the channel construct internal\n  to StackStorm's notification system. Make sure this value is set to whatever\n  is assigned the rule that defines a StackStrom channel. e.g. `hubot` is a value\n  that works well with the `hubot` pack found at\n  https://github.com/StackStorm/st2contrib/tree/master/packs/hubot.\n\n## Running the bot\n\nTo run the bot, go to your bot directory and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nST2_AUTH_USERNAME=testu ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD=testp HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=token ST2_ROUTE=mychannel PORT=8181 bin/hubot --name \"st2-bot\" -a slack --alias !\n```\n\n\nKeep in mind that you need to replace values of the environment variables so they\nreflect configuration of your environment.\n\n## Known issues / limitations\n\nPlease see https://github.com/StackStorm/hubot-stackstorm/issues\n\n## Testing\n\n### Lint\n\n```bash\ngulp lint\n```\n\n### Tests\n\n```bash\ngulp test\n```\n\n## Publishing\n\nReminder to ourselves, instead of bumping the version manually, use `mversion`.\n\n```\nnpm install -g mversion\nmversion patch\n```\n\nThis will bump the version in `package.json`, commit and create a tag with format described in `.mversionrc`.\n\n## Copyright, License, and Contributors Agreement\n\nCopyright 2015 StackStorm, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this work except\nin compliance with the License.
