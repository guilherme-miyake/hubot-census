hubot-rapture\n\nReports the current rapture index as defined by http://www.raptureready.com\n\n# Usage\n\nTo get the current rapture index, say `hubot rapture me`\n\n### Running hubot-rapture Locally\n\nYou can test your hubot by running the following.\n\nYou can start hubot-rapture locally by running:\n\n    % bin/hubot\n\nYou'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a\nprompt:\n\n    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell\n    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts\n    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts\n    Hubot>\n\nThen you can interact with hubot-rapture by typing `hubot-rapture help`.\n\n    hubot-rapture> hubot-rapture help\n\n    hubot-rapture> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few\n    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.\n    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.\n    ...\n\n\n### Scripting\n\nAn example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to\nget started, along with the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).\n\nFor many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just\nthe thing.\n\n### hubot-scripts\n\nThere will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead\nof writing it yourself, you can check\n[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] for existing scripts.\n\nTo enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with\nextension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this\nrepo.\n\n[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts\n\n### external-scripts\n\nHubot is able to load scripts from third-party `npm` package. Check the package's documentation, but in general it is:\n\n1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`\n2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed\n3. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string\n\nYou can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.\n\n##  Persistence\n\nIf you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package\n(strongly suggested), you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified\naccount or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually\nset the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.\n\n    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL=\"...\"\n\nIf you don't require any persistence feel free to remove the\n`hubot-redis-brain` from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry\nabout redis at all.\n\n[redistogo]: https://redistogo.com/\n\n## Adapters\n\nAdapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on. This\ncan be something like Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party\nadapters that the community have contributed. Check\n[Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the available ones.\n\nIf you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add\nthe adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the\n`dependencies` section.\n\nOnce you've added the dependency and run `npm install` to install it you can\nthen run hubot with the adapter.\n\n    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>\n\nWhere `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Deployment\n\n    % heroku create --stack cedar\n    % git push heroku master\n\nIf your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable\nand add the Redis to Go addon to your app.\n\n    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano\n\nIf you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].\n\nYou'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.\n\nMore detailed documentation can be found on the\n[deploying hubot onto Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.\n\n### Deploying to UNIX or Windows\n\nIf you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.\nPlease check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and\n[deploying hubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.\n\n[heroku-node-docs]: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js\n[deploy-heroku]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md\n[deploy-unix]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n[deploy-windows]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n\n## Campfire Variables\n\nIf you are using the Campfire adapter you will need to set some environment\nvariables. Refer to the documentation for other adapters and the configuraiton\nof those, links to the adapters can be found on [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters].\n\nCreate a separate Campfire user for your bot and get their token from the web\nUI.\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=\"...\"\n\nGet the numeric IDs of the rooms you want the bot to join, comma delimited. If\nyou want the bot to connect to `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/42`\nand `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/1024` then you'd add it like this:\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS=\"42,1024\"\n\nAdd the subdomain hubot should connect to. If you web URL looks like\n`http://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com` then you'd add it like this:\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=\"mysubdomain\"\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Restart the bot\n\nYou may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart`\nif you're having issues.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"awentzonline","email":"awentz@theonion.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-12-16T18:49:05.273Z","created":"2014-12-14T22:31:06.638Z","0.0.1":"2014-12-14T22:31:06.638Z","0.0.2":"2014-12-14T22:36:30.858Z","0.0.3":"2014-12-14T22:39:51.753Z","0.0.4":"2014-12-16T18:45:26.762Z","0.0.5":"2014-12-16T18:49:05.273Z"},"author":{"name":"Adam Wentz","email":"awentz@theonion.com"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/awentzonline/hubot-rapture","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/awentzonline/hubot-rapture.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/awentzonline/hubot-rapture/issues"}}
