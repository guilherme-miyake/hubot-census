But if you're having a conversation where you trigger it in almost every message, it can be a pain:\n\n![Hammertime.](http://i.imgur.com/5n5chQt.png)\n\nWith **Hubot Rate Limiter**, you can add a rate limit to Hubot commands, so that once they're triggered, they won't be triggered again until a certain period has elapsed.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nYou don't call it directly, instead, just include the script and then emit an event with a callback.\n\n    robot.emit 'rate-limit', key, limitTimeMilliseconds, callback\n    \n* *key* is a key you specify for the command, which is used to store it in the Redis brain (which keeps track of which commands are currently rate limited)\n* *limitTimeMilliseconds* is how long you'd like to wait before the command can be triggered again. To use the default timeout of 5 minutes, use 0 for this argument.\n* *callback* is the code you want to execute if the command isn't currently rate limited.\n\nHere's an example, using the earlier Hubot script:\n\n    module.exports = (robot) ->\n      robot.hear /stop/i, (msg) ->\n        robot.emit 'rate-limit', 'hammertime', 0, () ->\n          msg.send 'Hammertime.'\n          \nSo, when Hubot responds to this, the callback is only executed if the command is not currently rate limited.\n\n## Installation via NPM\n\nRun the following command to install this module as a Hubot dependency\n\n```\nnpm install hubot-rate-limiter --save\n```\n\nConfirm that hubot-standup-alarm appears as a dependency in your Hubot package.json file.\n\n```\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"hubot\":              \"2.x\",\n  \"hubot-scripts\":      \"2.x\",\n  \"hubot-rate-limiter\": \"*\"\n}\n```\n\nTo enable the script, add the hubot-standup-alarm entry to the external-scripts.json file (you may need to create this file).\n\n```\n  [\"hubot-rate-limiter\"]\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free!
