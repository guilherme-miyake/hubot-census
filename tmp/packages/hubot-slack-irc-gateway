adaptor with irc-gateway for hubot\n\n\nFor who\n-------------\n\n  * cannot receive outgoing webhooks\n    * probably because of firewall\n  * cannot create a hubot's slack account\n    * because slack charge to each account\n\nNot for who\n-------------\n\n  * can receive outgoing webhooks\n    * use [hubot-slack](https://github.com/tinyspeck/hubot-slack)\n  * can create account per each hubot\n    * use [hubot-irc](https://github.com/nandub/hubot-irc)\n\nTry\n-------------\n\n```shell\nexport HUBOT_IRC_PORT=6667\n\n# settings for slack api\n# @see https://api.slack.com/\nexport HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=your_slack_token_here\nexport HUBOT_IRC_SERVER=your.domain.slack.com\n\n# settings for irc gateway\n# @see https://YOUR.DOMAIN.slack.com/account/gateways\nexport

mybot\n```\n\nHow it works\n--------------\n\n  * receive messages using Slack's ircgateway\n  * post messages with slack API\n    * ircgateway has more strict limitation of use than API\n","maintainers":[{"name":"hiking","email":"hikingko1@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-12-07T10:57:02.073Z","created":"2014-12-07T10:15:48.298Z","0.1.0":"2014-12-07T10:15:48.298Z","0.1.1":"2014-12-07T10:55:27.795Z","0.1.2":"2014-12-07T10:57:02.073Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Hi-king/hubot-slack-irc-gateway","keywords":["hubot","slack","adapter"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/Hi-king/hubot-slack-irc-gateway.git"},"author":{"name":"Keisuke
