Hubot DC Adapter (Not Really)\n\n## Description\n\nThis is a DC \"Adapter\". While in reality, it implements most of the client protocols to make things work. It is called \"Adapter\" because hubot calls it that.\n\n## Configuring the Adapter\n\nThe IRC adapter requires only the following environment variables.\n\n* `HUBOT_DC_SERVER`\n* `HUBOT_DC_NICK`\n* `HUBOT_DC_DESCRIPTION`\n\nAnd the following are optional.\n\n* `HUBOT_DC_SPOOF_SHARE`\n\n### DC Server\n\nThis is the full hostname or IP address of the DC server you want your hubot to connect to. Make a note of it.\n\n### DC Nick\n\nThis is the nick you want your hubot to join with.\n\n## DC Description\n\nThe description that will show up in for your bot.\n\n## Contribute\n\nHere's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project.\n\n1. Fork the project\n2. Clone down your fork\n3. Create a feature branch\n4. Hack away and add tests, not necessarily in that order\n5. Make sure everything still passes by running tests\n6. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks without errors\n7. Push the branch up to your fork\n8. Send a pull request for your branch\n\n## Credits\n\nShamelessly copied from [hubot-irc](https://github.com/nandub/hubot-irc)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"parthkolekar","email":"parth.kolekar@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-10T10:26:12.458Z","created":"2017-03-20T14:17:08.506Z","1.0.0":"2017-03-20T14:17:08.506Z","1.0.1":"2017-03-20T14:22:23.931Z","1.0.2":"2017-03-23T09:59:05.236Z","1.0.3":"2017-03-30T20:10:13.047Z","1.0.4":"2017-03-30T20:17:44.921Z","1.1.0":"2017-03-30T20:19:43.940Z","1.1.1":"2017-05-10T10:26:12.458Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ParthKolekar/hubot-dc#readme","keywords":["hubot","dc","direct","hubot-dc","connect"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ParthKolekar/hubot-dc.git"},"author":{"name":"Parth Kolekar"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ParthKolekar/hubot-dc/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
