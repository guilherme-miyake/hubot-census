out-of-the-box hubot standard help.\nCommand options are organized by the script in which they are found, which reduces noise when a user is trying\nto figure out what hubot can do.\n\n```\nbob  > hubot help\nhubot> bob: I can do a lot of things!  Which would you like to know more about? You can say:  \n\n* hubot help hangouts - Create hangouts with Hubot.  \n* hubot help meme - Get a meme from http://memecaptain.com/  \n* hubot help pugme - Pugme is the most important thing in life  \n* hubot help maps - Interacts with the Google Maps API.  \n* hubot help rules - Make sure that hubot knows the rules.  \n* hubot help rss-reader - Hubot RSS Reader  \n* hubot help youtube - YouTube video search  \n* hubot help shipit - Rodent Motivation  \n\n\nOr you can see all commands by typing `hubot help all`.\n\n```\n\nThe user can dive in deeper by specifying the name of the script or module in which the commands are defined:\n\n```\nbob  > hubot help meme\nhubot> bob: Get a meme from http://memecaptain.com/  \n\n* hubot <text> (SUCCESS|NAILED IT) - Meme: Success kid w/ top caption  \n* hubot <text> ALL the <things> - Meme: ALL THE THINGS  \n* hubot <text> TOO DAMN <high> - Meme: THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH guy  \n* hubot <text>, <text> EVERYWHERE - Meme: Generates Buzz Lightyear  \n* hubot <text>, AND IT'S GONE - Meme: Bank Teller  \n* hubot <text>, BITCH PLEASE <text> - Meme: Yao Ming  \n* hubot <text>, COURAGE <text> - Meme: Courage Wolf  \n* hubot Aliens guy <text> - Meme: Aliens guy  \n* hubot All your <text> are belong to <text> - Meme: All your <text> are belong to <text>  \n* hubot Brace yourself <text> - Meme: Ned Stark braces for <text>  \n* hubot I don't always <something> but when i do <text> - Meme: The Most Interesting man in the World  \n* hubot IF <text> THAT'D BE GREAT - Meme: Generates Lumberg  \n* hubot IF YOU <text> GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME - Meme: Ski Instructor  \n* hubot IF YOU <text> TROLLFACE <text> - Meme: Troll Face  \n* hubot If <text>, <question> <text>? - Meme: Philosoraptor  \n* hubot Iron Price <text> - Meme: To get <text>? Pay the iron price!  \n* hubot MUCH <text> (SO|VERY) <text> - Meme: Generates Doge  \n* hubot Not sure if <something> or <something else> - Meme: Futurama Fry  \n* hubot ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY <text> - Meme: Boromir  \n* hubot WHAT IF I TOLD YOU <text> - Meme: Morpheus \"What if I told you\"  \n* hubot WTF <text> - Meme: Picard WTF  \n* hubot Y U NO <text> - Meme: Y U NO GUY w/ bottom caption  \n* hubot Yo dawg <text> so <text> - Meme: Yo Dawg  \n* hubot khanify <text> - Meme: Has Shatner yell your phrase  \n* hubot pun | bad joke eel <text> / <text> - Meme: Bad joke eel  \n* hubot pun | bad joke eel <text>? <text> - Meme: Bad joke eel\n\n```\n\nIf the user messes up a command then the help module tries to figure out what they meant:\n\n```\nbob  > hubot brace your self for awesome help!\nhubot> bob: Sorry, I didn't catch that.  Try one of these?\n* hubot Brace yourself <text> - Meme: Ned Stark braces for <text>\n\n```\n\nThe module also responds to mentions or greetings in order to introduce itself, so that new users can discover hubot\nand learn what it can do\n\n```\n*sally has entered the room\nbob  > Hi sally!  Welcome to the chat.  If you need help with anything you can always ask hubot.\nhubot> Hi, I'm hubot.  Nice to meet you!\nYou can ask me a question by typing my name, or even direct messaging me!\nTry it now by typing this:\n`hubot help`\n\nsally> hi hubot\nhubot> Hiya!  Want to ask me a question?  Just type `hubot help`\n```\n\nhubot-better-help accomplishes all this by re-implementing the parsing logic of Hubot.  Normally Hubot parses\nthe header files of scripts and then combines all the commands in one array.  hubot-better-help instead maintains\nan associative array of module names to commands, and combines them on the fly.  This allows to to reduce a lot of\nnoise when you start including a significant number of modules, or those modules like \"hubot-memes\" which have a lot\nof commands.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-better-help --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-better-help** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-better-help\"]\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"gburgett","email":"gordon@gordonburgett.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-27T22:46:03.216Z","created":"2017-05-27T21:47:21.601Z","0.0.3":"2017-05-27T21:47:21.601Z","0.0.4":"2017-05-27T22:18:41.023Z","0.0.5":"2017-05-27T22:26:33.714Z","0.1.0":"2017-05-27T22:46:03.216Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/CruAlbania/hubot-better-help#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/CruAlbania/hubot-better-help.git"},"author":{"name":"Gordon Burgett","email":"gordon@gordonburgett.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/CruAlbania/hubot-better-help/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
