Hubot Response\n\nMakes writing hubot scripts as easy as\n\n```\n{\n  \"match\": \"Hello\",\n  \"description\": \"hello - finish hello world!\",\n  \"listener\": \"hear\",\n  \"response\": [\n    \"World!\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## TL;DR\n\n**Install**\n\n```\nnpm install --save hubot-response\n```\n\n**Register**\n\nIn `external-scripts.json` add\n\n```\n\"hubot-response\"\n```\n\n**Make your own responses**\n\nCreate a `responses` directory. Create `mysweetresponse.json` and add\n\n```\n{\n  \"match\": \"Hello\",\n  \"description\": \"hello - finish hello world!\",\n  \"listener\": \"hear\",\n  \"response\": [\n    \"World!\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNow when hubot hears `Hello` in the room, it replies back with `World!`. Run `npm start` to try it out!\n\nCheckout more [examples](examples/).\n\n## Environment Variables\n`HUBOT_RESPONSE_GLOB` - [`Glob`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) of where to look for responses. Defaults to `responses/*.*`\n\n## How to use\nHubot Response can read anything that can be `reqire`-ed as an object. So `json`, `js`, `coffee` files all work.\n\nThe file should export either an object for [**one** response](examples/hello-world.json), or an array for [**multiple** responses](examples/multiple.coffee).\n\nEach response object should consist of:\n- `match` - Either a string that is turned into a regex, or an actual instance of `RegExp` that the robot is listening for.\n- `description` - Entry for hubot commands. Use this to display with `hubot-help`. See [Commands](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#documenting-scripts) for formatting.\n- `listener` - Either [`hear` or `respond`](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#hearing-and-responding).\n- `response` - Can be a `String`, `Function` that is called, or an `Array` where an index is randomly selected.\n\n## Try before you buy\nClone this locally and run\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will run a local hubot-shell. You can interact with the [examples](examples/).\n\n**Protip**: Run `hubot help` for a list of available commands.\n\n## Don't we already have [a way of doing this](https://github.com/hubot-scripts)?\nYes, and the [hubot-scripts](https://github.com/hubot-scripts) org is awesome! But for simple hear and respond modules (animated gifs mostly) customization sucks...\n\nSay you want to use this awesome [business-cat](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-business-cat) script, but *really* want to add an image.\n\nYou have 3 options:\n- Copy and paste the script into your hubot scripts folder and modify it there.\n- Fork it and modify it. Then deal with merge conflicts.\n- Submit a pull request, but maybe no one else want's your stupid cat picture?\n\nNone of these are really clean.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSince response files are just an object, we can extend however we want. You can see an example of this in the [extension example](examples/extension.js).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"michaeljacobdavis","email":"michael.jacob.davis@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-09-10T00:23:14.834Z","created":"2015-09-05T23:04:33.681Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-05T23:04:33.681Z","1.0.1":"2015-09-06T01:15:06.498Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-06T18:07:19.941Z","1.1.1":"2015-09-06T18:12:19.082Z","1.1.2":"2015-09-06T18:14:58.151Z","1.1.3":"2015-09-07T02:17:17.321Z","1.2.0":"2015-09-10T00:23:14.834Z"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","response"],"homepage":"https://github.com/michaeljacobdavis/hubot-response#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/michaeljacobdavis/hubot-response.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/michaeljacobdavis/hubot-response/issues"}}
