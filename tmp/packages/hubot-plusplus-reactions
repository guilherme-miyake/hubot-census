Using the :one::two::three: emojis. Less spam in chat.\n\nAPI\n---\n\n* `thing++` - add a point to `thing`\n* `++` - add a point to the most previously voted-on thing\n* `thing++ for stuff` - keep track of why you gave thing points\n* `thing--` - remove a point from `thing`\n* `--` - remove a point from the most previously voted-on thing\n* `thing-- for stuff` - keep track of why you removed thing points\n* `hubot erase thing` - erase thing from scoreboard (permanently deletes thing from memory)\n* `hubot erase thing for reason` erase given reason from thing's score board (does not deduct from total score)\n* `hubot top 10` - show the top 10, with a graph of points\n* `hubot score thing` - check the score for and reasons for `thing`\n\nUses Hubot brain. Also exposes the following events, should you wish to hook\ninto it to do things like print out funny gifs for point streaks:\n\n```coffeescript\nrobot.emit \"plus-one\", {\n  name: 'Jack'\n  direction: '++' # (or --)\n  room: 'chatRoomAlpha'\n  reason: 'being awesome'\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command\n\n    $ npm install hubot-plusplus\n\nThen to make sure the dependencies are installed:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nTo enable the script, add a `hubot-plusplus` entry to the `external-scripts.json`\nfile (you may need to create this file).\n\n    [\"hubot-plusplus\"]\n\n## Configuration\n\nSome of the behavior of this plugin is configured in the environment:\n\n`HUBOT_PLUSPLUS_KEYWORD` - alters the word you use to ask for the points, default `score`.\n`HUBOT_PLUSPLUS_REASONS` - the text used for the word \"reasons\" when hubot lists the top-N report, default `raisins`.\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"brousalis","email":"brousapg@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-01T15:40:22.329Z","created":"2016-07-01T15:40:22.329Z","1.2.4":"2016-07-01T15:40:22.329Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/brousalis/hubot-plusplus#readme","keywords":["hubot","points","plus","karma"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/brousalis/hubot-plusplus.git"},"author":{"name":"Jack Lawson","email":"https://github.com/ajacksified"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ajacksified/hubot-plusplus/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
