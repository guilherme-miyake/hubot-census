Hubot Poker\n\nLet's play some poker. Hubot-style.\n\nThis all started as a bit of a lark screwing around with analyzing\n6-digit SecurID tokens for poker-type patterns with fellow\nLivingSocialites. Turned it into a few games that we'd play from\ntime-to-time in Campfire, though they were limited in that there was no\nway to deal 'digits' to players privately.\n\nThen we went to Slack and that opened up some possibilities for dealing\ncards. I made a Texas Hold 'em-styled game and here we are.\n\n## Card Poker\n\nThe only card-styled game thus far is Texas Hold 'em - checkout its\n[README](js/card-poker/README.md).\n\n## Token Poker\n\nThere are three different games, though two of them are only\nstarter/experimental. The third is a game call Reverse Hold 'em which is\na loose take on Texas Hold 'em where all of the players hands are\nvisible, but the hole cards (digits) are hidden until the end. Checkout\nits [README](js/token-poker/README.md).\n\n## Contributors \n\n[chrismo](https://github.com/chrismo) - Genius behind the version available now.\n\n[robksawyer](https://github.com/robksawyer) - Created a hubot poker game that sucked and then later was informed of chrismo's. I then merged his version into my repo since I also had [hubot-poker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-poker) on <https://www.npmjs.com>.","maintainers":[{"name":"chrismo","email":"chrismo@clabs.org"},{"name":"robksawyer","email":"robksawyer@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-26T08:57:57.566Z","created":"2014-12-14T01:21:59.885Z","0.0.1":"2014-12-14T01:21:59.885Z","0.0.2":"2014-12-14T05:43:09.957Z","0.0.3":"2014-12-14T05:55:13.288Z","0.0.4":"2014-12-14T06:01:13.807Z","0.0.6":"2014-12-15T08:02:48.251Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-09T19:34:53.121Z","1.0.3":"2015-03-09T19:36:26.631Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chrismo/hubot-poker","keywords":["game","hubot","slack","poker"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/chrismo/hubot-poker"},"author":{"name":"chrismo","email":"chrismo@clabs.org","url":"http://clabs.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chrismo/hubot-poker/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"robksawyer":true,"metagard":true}}
