It's meant to welcome users during quiet times.\n* Remembers every nick it sees (even nick changes) and won't greet anyone twice \n  (remembers over a restart as well if a persistent brain is used).\n* Discovers who's in a channel when it joins and won't welcome any of them if they rejoin.\n* Defaults to quiet mode when it first enters a channel. Will just idle in the channel and learn\n  nicks. Say `welcoming approved` to it in the channel to have it start welcoming newcomers.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn your hubot project run `npm install --save hubot-contributejson`. Then add `\"hubot-contributejson\"`\nto your `external-scripts.json`. Also make sure [hubot-auth][] is installed and in your\n`external-scripts.json` as well. You can optionally install [hubot-cronjob][] to\nenable automatic updates for the contribute.json data nightly.\n\n### NOTE\n\nIt is ***highly*** recommended that you use a persistent hubot brain store (like [hubot-redis-brain][]).\n\n## Configuration\n\nAll configuration is optional.\n\n`HUBOT_CONTRIBUTE_WELCOME_WAIT`: Number of seconds to wait after a new user joins the channel and no one else speaks to say something. (default: 60)\n\n`HUBOT_CONTRIBUTE_ENABLE_CRON`: Use the `hubot-cronjob` script to update all of the contribute.json data every night.\n\n## Commands\n\nIn order to run the following commands you must add yourself to the `contributejson` role via the `hubot-auth` script. From an admin user issue the\nfollowing command: `<hubot>: <user> has contributejson role`. This will allow `<user>` to run the commands below.\n\n`<hubot>: contributejson list`: List the channels and contribute.json URLs known by the bot.\n\n`<hubot>: contributejson add <url>`: Add a contribute.json URL to the list and join the channel in the file.\n\n`<hubot>: contributejson rm [url]`: Remove a contribute.json URL from the list and leave the channel. If run from the desired channel the `[url]` is optional.\n\n`<hubot>: contributejson update [url]`: Update the data for the contribute.json URL or channel. If run from the desired channel the `[url]` is optional.\n\n`<hubot>: welcoming approved`: Enable welcome messages to new users in the channel.\n\n`<hubot>: welcoming denied`: Disable welcome messages to new users in the channel. Will just learn nicks.
