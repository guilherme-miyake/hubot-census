hubot-keepalive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nibroc/hubot-keepalive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nibroc/hubot-keepalive)\n\nA script that has Hubot periodically message itself so connections (namely Slack) don't time out.\n\nSee [`src/keepalive.coffee`](src/keepalive.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, add `hubot-keepalive` and `cron` to your `packages.json`, `npm install`,\nthen add `hubot-keepalive` to your `external-scripts.json`.\n\n# Supported configuration\n\nCurrently this script is only tested on Slack as the purpose of this script is to work around\na bug where the slack adapter will drop connections and then not reconnect. A proper fix is in\nthe works [here](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack/issues/203). Or, there's also a bit of\nbackground in [this issue](https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/1013).\n\n## NPM Module\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-keepalive\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nibroc","email":"hughes.corbin@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-21T05:01:16.464Z","created":"2016-07-21T04:52:27.138Z","0.0.0":"2016-07-21T04:52:27.138Z","0.0.1":"2016-07-21T04:55:15.585Z","0.0.2":"2016-07-21T05:01:16.464Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nibroc/hubot-keepalive#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","timeout","keepalive","ping","pong","keep-alive","slack","hubot-slack-adapter"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/nibroc/hubot-keepalive.git"},"author":{"name":"Corbin Hughes","email":"hughes.corbin@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nibroc/hubot-keepalive/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
