Status](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-rbac.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-rbac)\n\n__This script relies on a new Hubot [v2.14.0](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v2140) feature known as ['listener middleware'](https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/803). It WILL NOT work on older versions of Hubot.__\n\nA Hubot script for restricting access to commands through [role-based access control (RBAC)][rbac], and [Listener IDs][options].\n\nRoles are automatically created when policies are added / removed (e.g. when a listener ID is blocked).\n\n### Caveats\n\n- Currently, the script can only block listeners IF they have an ID attached to it via their [options / metadata][options];\n- Furthermore, the full ID must be specified when creating policies;\n- None of the script's commands are blocked by default (i.e. anyone can use it, but they can not use it against a power user).\n\nSee [`src/rbac.coffee`](src/rbac.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n\n## Installation via NPM\n\n1. Install the **hubot-rbac** module as a Hubot dependency by running:\n\n    ```\n    npm install --save hubot-rbac\n    ```\n\n2. Enable the module by adding the **hubot-rbac** entry to your `external-scripts.json` file:\n\n    ```json\n    [\n        \"hubot-rbac\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. Run your bot and see below for available config / commands\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nVariable | Default | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n`HUBOT_RBAC_POWER_USERS` | N/A | A comma-separated list of user names to be granted complete, and immutable permissions.\n\n\n## Commands\n\nCommand | Listener ID | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nhubot auth me | `auth.me` | Returns your current role(s).\nhubot auth block `listener ID` `role` | `auth.block` | Blocks `listener ID` from being executed by subjects in `role`.\nhubot auth unblock `listener ID` `role` | `auth.unblock` | Unblocks `listener ID` for subjects in `role`.\nhubot auth assign `subject` `role` | `auth.assign` | Assigns `subject` to `role`.\nhubot auth unassign `subject` `role` | `auth.unassign` | Unassigns `subject` from `role`.\nhubot auth default `role` | `auth.default` | Changes the default `role` for unassigned subjects.\nhubot auth ids | `auth.ids` | Returns a list of listener IDs that can be blocked.\nhubot auth roles | `auth.roles` | Returns a list of roles, and their respective subjects.\n\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot links list\nhubot>> user1: Nothing has been shared recently.\nuser1>> hubot auth me\nhubot>> user1: You are not assigned to any roles.\nuser1>> hubot auth block links.list nolinkrecording\nhubot>> user1: Listener ID \"links.list\" is blocked for \"nolinkrecording\" subjects.\nuser1>> hubot auth assign user1 nolinkrecording\nhubot>> user1: Assigned \"user1\" to \"nolinkrecording\".\nuser1>> hubot links list\nhubot>> user1: Sorry, you are not authorised to execute that command.\nuser1>> hubot auth me\nhubot>> user1: You have been assigned the following role(s): nolinkrecording\n```\n\n\n[rbac]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control\n[options]: https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/#listener-metadata","maintainers":[{"name":"mrsaints","email":"ian@fyianlai.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-05-29T21:15:14.767Z","created":"2015-10-27T01:15:18.229Z","0.0.2":"2015-10-27T01:15:18.229Z","0.0.3":"2015-11-18T00:35:01.749Z","0.1.0":"2016-05-29T21:15:14.767Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-rbac#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","acl","rbac","roles","authorization","authentication","restriction","whitelist","blacklist","command"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-rbac.git"},"author":{"name":"Ian Lai","email":"os@fyianlai.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-rbac/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
