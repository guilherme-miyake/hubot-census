foobar\n```\n\n# Release\n\n```\n# Ask if you can release that application to that environment\nhubot can I release foobar to staging?\n#=> yes, foobar is releasable to staging\n\n# Release foobar/master to staging\nhubot release foobar/master to staging\n#=> user is now releasing hubot\\/master to staging for 60 minutes\n\nhubot release foobar/master to staging for 30 minutes\n#=> user is now releasing hubot\\/master to staging for 30 minutes\n\nhubot release foobar/master to staging for 2 hours\n#=> user is now releasing hubot\\/master to staging for 120 minutes\n\n# Let other
