plugin is the brother of [hubot-cron-events](https://github.com/Gandi/hubot-cron-events) but specialised in one-time events triggered at a given time.\n\n*Work in progress* - this plugin is ready for use but still very experimental.\n\n\nInstallation\n--------------\nIn your hubot directory:    \n\n    npm install hubot-at-events --save\n\nThen add `hubot-at-events` to `external-scripts.json`\n\n\nConfiguration\n-----------------\n\nIf you use [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth), the plugin configuration commands will be restricted to user with the `admin` role. \n\nIf hubot-auth is not loaded, all users can access those commands. You can use those variables to tune things up a bit.\n\n- `HUBOT_AT_NOAUTH` - if defined, it will bypass the need to be admin to use the `.at` commands\n- `HUBOT_AT_AUTH_GROUP` - if defined it will permit group specified to use the `.at` commands\n\nIt's also advised to use a brain persistence plugin, whatever it is, to persist the cron jobs between restarts.\n\n\nCommands\n--------------\n\n**Note: until version 1.0.0, this readme is a roadmap, not a real documentation. This is a Readme-driven development approach.**\n\nCommands prefixed by `.at` or `.in` are here taking in account we use the `.` as hubot prefix, just replace it with your prefix if it is different. Uncommented commands are just not yet implemented.\n\n    .at version\n        gives the version of the hubot-at-events package loaded\n\n    .at <date> [in <tz>] [run <name>] do <event> [with param1=value1]\n        schedules triggering of <event> at given <date>\n        - <date> has to be in the future\n        - params can be provided to be transmitted to the <event>\n        - if you don't provide a <name> for the action (using 'run <name>')\n          then a random name will be attributed to it,\n          as it's needed for later cancellation or modification\n        - if no <tz> is provided, the server tz will be applied\n\n    .at <date> [in <tz>] [run <name>] say [in #<room>] <message>\n        same as above, except that the event will be 'at.message'\n        - if the <room> is omitted, it will be set to the room \n          where the command is done\n        - the action will be given a random name.\n\n    .at <date> [in <tz>] [run <name>] say [to <username>] <message>\n        same as above, except that the message will be said to the <username> in private\n\n    .in <number> <unit> [run <name>] do <event> [with param1=value1]\n        same as with .at command, but using time relative to now\n        acceptable units are\n        - s, sec, second, seconds\n        - m, min, minute, minutes\n        - h, hour, hours\n        - d, day, days\n        - w, week, weeks\n        - month, months\n        - y, year, years\n        For the rest, it behaves exactly like the .at command\n\n    .in <number> <unit> [run <name>] say [in #<room>] <message>\n        same as above, except that the message will be said to the <username> in private\n\n    .in <number> <unit> [run <name>] say [to <username>] <message>\n\n    .at enable <name>\n        activate an action that was previously disabled\n\n    .at disable <name>\n        disable an action but without deleting it, so it can be re-enabled later\n\n    .at list [<term>]\n        will list all actions matching <term>\n        if no <term> is provided, it will just list all actions\n\n    .at cancel <name>\n        removes the action, all data about it will be lost\n\n    .at <name> with <key> = <value>\n\n    .at <name> drop <key>\n\nSome events receivers are also provided for testing purposes:\n\n    at.message\n        requires data:\n        - room\n        - message\n        it will just say the message in the given room\n\n\nTesting\n----------------\n\n    npm install\n\n    # will run make test and coffeelint\n    npm test \n    \n    # or\n    make test\n    \n    # or, for watch-mode\n    make test-w\n\n    # or for more documentation-style output\n    make test-spec\n\n    # and to generate coverage\n    make test-cov\n\n    # and to run the lint\n    make lint\n\n    # run the lint and the coverage\n    make\n\nChangelog\n---------------\nAll changes are listed in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n\nContribute\n--------------\nFeel free to open a PR if you find any bug, typo, want to improve documentation, or think about a new feature. \n\nGandi loves Free and Open Source Software.
