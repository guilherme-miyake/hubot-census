For example something like Marbach will not be found. You should have searched for Marbach (N).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nRun the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ npm install hubot-vvs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen make sure the dependencies are installed:\r\n```\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also want to consider running the first command with the `--save` option to add it to your package.json so you don't have to install it manually every time.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYour hubot will listen to the following command:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n`hubot vvs from <origin> to <destination>`\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```\r\nhubot> hubot vvs from gärtringen to herrenberg\r\nhubot> The S1 from Gärtringen to Herrenberg leaves at 17:11\r\nhubot> The S1 from Gärtringen to Herrenberg leaves at 17:24\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nThere may be some bugs in this script. If you encounter any please open an issue and I will try to fix them as soon as possible.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"subhuman","email":"sebi.wachter@online.de"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-27T16:14:27.934Z","created":"2016-01-27T16:11:09.219Z","0.1.0":"2016-01-27T16:11:09.219Z","0.1.1":"2016-01-27T16:14:27.934Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sebastianwachter/hubot-vvs#readme","keywords":["hubot","vvs"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sebastianwachter/hubot-vvs.git"},"author":{"name":"Sebastian Wachter","email":"sebi.wachter@online.de"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sebastianwachter/hubot-vvs/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
