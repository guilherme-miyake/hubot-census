So here's the classic karma script\nrepackaged in the new npm package style format.  Use as you will.\n\n### Usage\n\n    <thing>++ - give thing some karma\n    <thing>-- - take away some of thing's karma\n    hubot karma <thing> - check thing's karma (if <thing> is omitted, show the top 5)\n    hubot karma empty <thing> - empty a thing's karma\n    hubot karma best - show the top 5\n    hubot karma worst - show the bottom 5\n\n### Installation (new style):\n\n1. cd into your hubot dir, run `npm install --save hubot-karma-classic` (adds a dependency in package.json).\n2. Add `\"hubot-karma-classic\"` to your `external-scripts.json` file.\n3. Restart Hubot.\n\n### Installation (old style):\n\nPlace hubot-karma-class.coffee to your hubot/scripts directory. Restart hubot.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"notpeter","email":"petertripp@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-11-18T23:52:10.949Z","created":"2014-10-25T00:03:34.256Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-25T00:03:34.256Z","1.0.1":"2014-10-25T00:06:43.086Z","1.0.2":"2015-05-19T19:09:18.697Z","1.0.3":"2016-11-18T23:52:10.949Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/notpeter/hubot-karma-classic","keywords":["hubot","karma"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/notpeter/hubot-karma-classic.git"},"author":{"name":"D.
