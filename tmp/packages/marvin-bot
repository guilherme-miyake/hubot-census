It was\ninitially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be\ndeployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.\n\nThis README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve\nto talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he\nhas, etc!\n\n[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com\n[hubot]: http://hubot.github.com\n[generator-hubot]: https://github.com/github/generator-hubot\n\n### Running marvin Locally\n\nYou can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not\nbehave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely\nupon have been set.\n\nYou can start marvin locally by running:\n\n    % bin/hubot\n\nYou'll see some start up output and a prompt:\n\n    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379\n    marvin>\n\nThen you can interact with marvin by typing `marvin help`.\n\n    marvin> marvin help\n    marvin animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]\n    marvin help - Displays all of the help commands that marvin knows about.\n    ...\n\n### Configuration\n\nA few scripts (including some installed by default) require environment\nvariables to be set as a simple form of configuration.\n\nEach script should have a commented header which contains a \"Configuration\"\nsection that explains which values it requires to be placed in which variable.\nWhen you have lots of scripts installed this process can be quite labour\nintensive. The following shell command can be used as a stop gap until an\neasier way to do this has been implemented.\n\n    grep -o 'hubot-[a-z0-9_-]\\+' external-scripts.json | \\\n      xargs -n1 -I {} sh -c 'sed -n \"/^# Configuration/,/^#$/ s/^/{} /p\" \\\n          $(find node_modules/{}/ -name \"*.coffee\")' | \\\n        awk -F '#' '{ printf \"%-25s %s\\n\", $1, $2 }'\n\nHow to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.\nRather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,\nit's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.\n\n### Scripting\n\nAn example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to\nget started, along with the [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).\n\nFor many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just\nthe thing.\n\n[scripting-docs]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md\n\n### external-scripts\n\nThere will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of\nwriting it yourself, you can use existing plugins.\n\nHubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the\nrecommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of\navailable hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:\n\n    % npm search hubot-scripts panda\n    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS\n    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda\n    ...\n\n\nTo use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:\n\n1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it\n2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string\n\nYou can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.\n\n##### Advanced Usage\n\nIt is also possible to define `external-scripts.json` as an object to\nexplicitly specify which scripts from a package should be included. The example\nbelow, for example, will only activate two of the six available scripts inside\nthe `hubot-fun` plugin, but all four of those in `hubot-auto-deploy`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hubot-fun\": [\n    \"crazy\",\n    \"thanks\"\n  ],\n  \"hubot-auto-deploy\": \"*\"\n}\n```\n\n**Be aware that not all plugins support this usage and will typically fallback\nto including all scripts.**\n\n[npmjs]: https://www.npmjs.com\n\n### hubot-scripts\n\nBefore hubot plugin packages were adopted, most plugins were held in the\n[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] package. Some of these plugins have yet to be\nmigrated to their own packages. They can still be used but the setup is a bit\ndifferent.\n\nTo enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with\nextension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this\nrepo.\n\n[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts\n\n##  Persistence\n\nIf you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested),\nyou will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified\naccount or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually\nset the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.\n\n    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL=\"...\"\n\nIf you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`\nfrom `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.\n\n[redistogo]: https://redistogo.com/\n\n## Adapters\n\nAdapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on, such\nas Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party adapters that the\ncommunity have contributed. Check [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the\navailable ones.\n\nIf you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add\nthe adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the\n`dependencies` section.\n\nOnce you've added the dependency with `npm install --save` to install it you\ncan then run hubot with the adapter.\n\n    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>\n\nWhere `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Deployment\n\n    % heroku create --stack cedar\n    % git push heroku master\n\nIf your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable\nand add the Redis to Go addon to your app.\n\n    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano\n\nIf you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].\n\nYou'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.\n\nMore detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto\nHeroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.\n\n### Deploying to UNIX or Windows\n\nIf you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.\nPlease check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and [deploying\nhubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.\n\n[heroku-node-docs]: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js\n[deploy-heroku]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md\n[deploy-unix]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n[deploy-windows]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n\n## Campfire Variables\n\nIf you are using the Campfire adapter you will need to set some environment\nvariables. If not, refer to your adapter documentation for how to configure it,\nlinks to the adapters can be found on [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters].\n\nCreate a separate Campfire user for your bot and get their token from the web\nUI.\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=\"...\"\n\nGet the numeric IDs of the rooms you want the bot to join, comma delimited. If\nyou want the bot to connect to `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/42`\nand `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/1024` then you'd add it like\nthis:\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS=\"42,1024\"\n\nAdd the subdomain hubot should connect to. If you web URL looks like\n`http://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com` then you'd add it like this:\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=\"mysubdomain\"\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Restart the bot\n\nYou may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if\nyou're having issues.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ouadie","email":"ouadiesoft@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-04-30T08:50:23.159Z","created":"2016-04-30T08:50:23.159Z","0.0.0":"2016-04-30T08:50:23.159Z"},"author":{"name":"Ouadie Lahdioui","email":"ouadiesoft@gmail.com"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
