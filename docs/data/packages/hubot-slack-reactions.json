hubot-slack-reactions\n\nA hubot script like [/star me](#starme) except for slack reactions. Suggestions welcome read over the [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.\n\nSee [`src/slack-reactions.coffee`](src/slack-reactions.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n#### Starme\n\nStar me is what we would use at GitHub to pull random campfire stars from the api and post them in chat. We would use this feature to\n\n- `star me -1year` Laugh about what we were saying a year ago today\n- `star me pizza` Laugh about people talking about pizza\n- `star me today` Catch up on the highlights from the chat room.\n\nSlack uses [emoji reactions](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206870317-Emoji-reactions) for all sorts of fun. This script does the same as the old star me, but uses reactions. There's even some useful shortcuts\n\n- `star me` Get messages with reaction :star:\n- `zap me` Get messages with reaction :zap:\n- `react me :poop:` Get messages with reaction :poop:\n- `react me @jonrohan :poop: -1year` Get the messages from jonrohan with reaction :poop: from one year ago today\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou'll need to get your [Slack API Auth token](https://api.slack.com/web#authentication). Once you've gotten it for your org, set it as an environment variable.\n\n```sh\nexport SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-slack-reactions --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-slack-reactions** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-slack-reactions\"\n]\n```\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot react me -1year\nhubot>> https://chat.slack.com/archives/general/p1d39f3463d000068\n```\n\n## Related\n\n* [hubot-rubygems-search](https://github.com/jonrohan/hubot-rubygems-search)\n* [hubot-itunes-search](https://github.com/jonrohan/hubot-itunes-search)\n\n## License\n\nMIT &copy; [Jon Rohan](http://jonrohan.codes)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jonrohan","email":"jon@jonrohan.me"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-12-11T16:23:24.691Z","created":"2015-08-19T13:23:34.752Z","0.0.1":"2015-08-19T13:23:34.752Z","0.0.2":"2015-08-19T13:48:18.054Z","0.0.3":"2015-08-19T16:33:53.256Z","0.0.4":"2015-08-19T16:43:27.262Z","0.1.0":"2015-11-12T22:41:45.684Z","0.1.1":"2015-11-12T23:12:53.344Z","0.2.0":"2015-12-02T00:38:14.404Z","0.3.0":"2017-12-11T16:23:24.691Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jonrohan/hubot-slack-reactions#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","slack","reactions","star","zap"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jonrohan/hubot-slack-reactions.git"},"author":{"name":"Jon Rohan","email":"yes@jonrohan.codes"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jonrohan/hubot-slack-reactions/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
