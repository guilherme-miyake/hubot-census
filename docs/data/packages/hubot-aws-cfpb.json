See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee [INSTALL](INSTALL.md)\n\n## Commands\n\n### List Instances\n\n#### Chat and my Instances\n```\ncfpbot ec2 [mine|chat]\n```\nThis command will list the instances created by chat bot. \n* mine - will list all instances you have created\n* chat - will list all instances that the chat bot has created.\n\n#### Filter instances\n```\ncfpbot ec2 filter [search_text]\n```\nThis command will show all instances that have the 'search_text' in the name.\n\n### Creating, Stopping & Extending\n\n#### Create Instances\n```ruby\ncfpbot ec2 run [name] [desc] \n```\nThis command will create a new ec2-instance. \n* name - The tag name that will be given to this ec2 instance.\n* desc - The tag desc that will be given to this ec2 instance\n\n#### Stop Instances\n```ruby\ncfpbot ec2 stop --instance_id=[instance_id]\n```\nThis command will stop, not terminate, an ec2-instance of a given id. It will only allow you to stop instances that you created. \n* instance_id - The instance id of the ec2 instance which you can get from the `List Instances` commands.\n\n#### Resume Instances\n```ruby\ncfpbot ec2 start [instance_id]\n```\nThis command will start an ec2-instance of a given id. \n* instance_id - The instance id of the ec2 instance which you can get from the `List Instances` commands.\n\n#### Extend an Instance's Expiration Date\n```ruby\ncfpbot ec2 extend [instance_id]\n```\nThis command will add two weeks to the expiration date of an ec2-instance created by cfpbot.\n* instance_id - The instance id of the ec2 instance which you can get from the `List Instances` commands.\n\n### Reserve instances\n\n```\ncfpbot ec2 reserve [instance_id_nickname] [branch name] [reservation comment]\ncfpbot ec2 unreserve [instance_id_nickname]\ncfpbot ec2 reserve-ls\n```\n\nThese three commands help coordinate ad hoc reservations of shared EC2 instances\nwithin a team or department. Consider a scenario where a team has a set of three\nstaging/QA boxes that have topic branches deployed to them: coordinating\nwho is using what can quickly become painful. These commands attempt to help\nwith this problem by using EC2 tags to track the state of a pre-defined set of\nreservable instances.\n\nDefine your instances-for-reservation in a JSON file kept in the bot's root (\npoint the bot to this file via the `HUBOT_AWS_RESERVE_CONFIG` env var):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"staging1\": \"i-EC2-INSTANCE-ID-HERE\",\n  \"staging2\": \"i-EC2-INSTANCE-ID-HERE\",\n  \"staging3\": \"i-EC2-INSTANCE-ID-HERE\",\n}\n```\n\nYou'd then reserve an instance like:\n\n```\ncfpbot ec2 reserve staging1 my-branch-name testing this new cool feature\n```\n\nWhen you are done testing:\n\n```\ncfpbot ec2 unreserve staging1\n```\n\nCheck the status of the instances to see what's available:\n\n```\ncfpbot ec2 reserve-ls\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"cfpb","email":"devops@cfpb.gov"},{"name":"contolini","email":"chris@contolini.com"},{"name":"imuchnik","email":"muchnik.irina@gmail.com"},{"name":"marcesher","email":"marc.esher@gmail.com"},{"name":"vickumar","email":"vickumar@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-04-18T14:10:07.928Z","created":"2016-05-10T17:29:10.692Z","1.0.0":"2016-05-10T17:29:10.692Z","1.0.1":"2016-05-10T20:54:00.655Z","0.0.3":"2016-05-11T17:37:20.987Z","1.0.2":"2016-05-11T17:51:08.955Z","1.0.3":"2016-05-18T14:32:14.912Z","1.0.4":"2016-05-31T14:53:05.072Z","1.0.5":"2016-05-31T19:55:00.936Z","1.0.6":"2016-06-01T12:05:16.882Z","1.0.7":"2016-06-16T14:33:04.373Z","1.0.8":"2016-12-19T15:04:45.502Z","1.1.0":"2017-04-04T23:15:15.498Z","1.1.1":"2017-04-06T20:48:14.592Z","1.1.2":"2017-12-08T16:39:54.117Z","1.1.3":"2017-12-20T15:23:36.290Z","1.1.4":"2017-12-20T23:26:21.695Z","1.1.6":"2017-12-21T20:37:18.526Z","1.1.7":"2018-03-16T20:20:22.114Z","1.1.8":"2018-04-18T14:10:03.491Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/cfpb/hubot-aws-cfpb","keywords":["aws","hubot","hubot-scripts","hubot aws","aws-cli"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/cfpb/hubot-aws-cfpb.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cfpb/hubot-aws-cfpb/issues"},"license":"CC0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"vghhkjh":true}}
