They will still be able to specify a fully qualified path in the form of user/repo.\r\n- `HUBOT_GITHUB_USER_SOMENAME` to map chat usernames to GitHub user logins.\r\n\r\nIt is also strongly advised to make sure your hubot's brain implementation is up and working (the default one is \r\n`redis-brain`).\r\n\r\n### Username Mapping\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to [use environment variables to map your users](#configuration), you can rely on the \r\n`github-credentials.coffee` scripts, available in the default `hubot-scripts` package. Each user can therefore map \r\ntheir own username against a GitHub user:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfra> hubot i am frapontillo\r\nhubot> Ok, you are frapontillo on GitHub\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers can also check their mapping:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfra> hubot who am i\r\nhubot> fra: You are known as frapontillo on GitHub\r\n```\r\n\r\n`hubot-github-notify` will honor these credentials before the ones in the environment variables; if no mapping is \r\neventually found, an error is shown to the user.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### Notify to mentions/assignments\r\n\r\nYou can get notified of mentions by telling hubot something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser> hubot notify me of mentions in some_user/some_repo\r\nhubot> You will now receive notifications for mentions in some_user/some_repo.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that:\r\n\r\n- to get notified of assignments, replace `mentions` with `assignments`\r\n- you can omit the `some_user/` username part, provided you specified the [`HUBOT_GITHUB_USER` among the environment\r\nvariables](#configuration)\r\n- you can omit the whole `in some_user/some_repo`, and you'll be notified for every repository that has a Webhook to the\r\ncurrent hubot session; every other mention or assignment notification setting will be deleted and overridden by this one\r\n- `me` and `of` are optional, they're there for the sake of English language\r\n\r\n#### Un-notify from mentions/assignments\r\n\r\nTo unsubscribe from mentions or assignments, go with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser> hubot unnotify me from mentions in some_user/some_repo\r\nhubot> You will no longer receive notifications for mentions in some_user/some_repo.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere as well, please note that:\r\n              \r\n- to unsubscribe from assignments, replace `mentions` with `assignments`\r\n- you can omit the `some_user/` username part, provided you specified the [`HUBOT_GITHUB_USER` among the environment\r\nvariables](#configuration)\r\n- you can omit the whole `in some_user/some_repo`, and you'll remove every subscription you previously registered\r\n- `me` and `from` are optional\r\n\r\n#### List mentions/assignments notifications\r\n\r\nYou can ask your hubot what notifications are active:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser> hubot list my mentions notifications\r\nhubot> You will receive notifications for mentions in some_user/some_repo.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same patterns as before apply here: you can replace `mentions` with `assignments` and `my` is optional.\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n\r\nhubot-github-notify uses the common directory structure for hubot script packages.\r\n\r\n### script\r\n\r\nThis directory is home to development scripts: `bootstrap` and `test` are used to bootstrap the development environment \r\nand run tests respectively.\r\n\r\n### src\r\n\r\nThis directory is home to the actual hubot scripts in the package. The `index.coffee` entry point will load the scripts \r\nfrom this directory.\r\n\r\n### test\r\n\r\nThis directory is home to all the tests for the scripts. Tests use Mocha, Chai and Sinon.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWhen reporting issues, please provide a full example of both configuration and execution.\r\n\r\nPull requests are most welcome, remember to always submit them against the `develop` branch.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\n   Copyright 2014 Francesco Pontillo\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n```","maintainers":[{"name":"frapontillo","email":"francescopontillo@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-10-10T15:52:29.418Z","created":"2014-10-10T15:52:29.418Z","0.0.1":"2014-10-10T15:52:29.418Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/frapontillo/hubot-github-notify","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","github","notification","notify"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/frapontillo/hubot-github-notify.git"},"author":{"name":"Francesco Pontillo","email":"francescopontillo@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/frapontillo/hubot-github-notify/issues"},"license":"Apache-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"frapontillo":true,"zchee":true},"_attachments":{}}
