It can be your own Community Edition server, or your projects on gitlab.com:\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nGITLAB_URL=\"https://mygitlabserver:3000/\"\n```\n\n#####GITLAB_API_KEY\n\nThe API key to allow Gitsy to access a GitLab account.  Obtain an API key from your GitLab account.  If you are an administrator, you can get an API key for the entire server, with visibility to all projects; as a user, your API key can only access your own proejects.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nGITLAB_API_KEY=\"aaaefadafasfasfasfafafasfa\"\n```\n\n##OTHER Required ENV variables\n\nGitsy handles incoming webhook events using the excellent [hubot-gitlab-hooks npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-gitlab-hooks).   You must configure the additional ENV variables required by this module for the webhook handling to operate correctly.\n\n#Operation\n\nYou can learn about the commands available by asking Gitsy for an introduction.\n\nNote that you must use the name you gave to your bot (assumed to be _hubot_ here):\n\n```\nhubot intro gitsy\n```\n\n\n\n","maintainers":[{"email":"chinello@gmail.com","name":"diegosampaio"},{"email":"rodrigoknascimento@gmail.com","name":"rodrigok"},{"email":"diego.dorgam@rocket.chat","name":"diegodorgam"},{"email":"sing.li@rocket.chat","name":"sing.li"},{"email":"tim@nestedcode.com","name":"timkinnane"},{"email":"graywolf336@craftyn.com","name":"graywolf336"},{"email":"buildmaster@rocket.chat","name":"rocketchat.buildmaster"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-09-13T14:16:02.075Z","created":"2015-12-09T00:32:39.895Z","0.8.0":"2015-12-09T00:32:39.895Z","0.8.3":"2015-12-11T05:45:47.688Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Ops","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","gitlab","rocketchat"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Ops.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Sing Li","email":"sing.li@rocket.chat"}],"author":{"name":"Rocket.Chat","email":"support@rocket.chat","url":"http://rocket.chat/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Ops/issues","email":"support@rocket.chat"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
