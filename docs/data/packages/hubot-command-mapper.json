A convention is used to map the command into the Hubot. The direct question `@hubot clear screen` will launch the `screen` command of the `clear` tool.\r\n\r\n_Why?_ Writing regular expressions for commands is hard. You have to spend some time to prevent some expressions from colliding with others. Now the mapper takes care of that problem.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nInstall the command mapper like this: `npm install hubot-command-mapper --save`\r\n\r\n## A simple example\r\nLet's define the _clear screen_ command by replying with 48 space-lines:\r\n```\r\nconst mapper = require(\"hubot-command-mapper\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = robot => {\r\n  const tool = {\r\n    name: \"clear\",\r\n    commands: [{\r\n        name: \"screen\",\r\n        invoke: (tool, robot, res)=>{\r\n            for(let i = 0 ; i < 48; i++){\r\n                res.emote(' ');\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }]\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  mapper(robot, tool);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe mapper will map the tool into the robot using the `respond` method. The `hear` method is currently not supported.\r\n\r\n## Extra commands\r\nEach tool has a view extra commands that will be added by the mapper:\r\n- `@hubot tool-name debug`: will show which regular expressions are mapped\r\n- `@hubot tool-name help`: will show the help of the tool, read from the original script file. It uses the help feature of Hubot.\r\n- `@hubot tool-name reload`: will reload the script without having to restart the Hubot. This makes development easier.\r\n\r\n## Full specification\r\nA **tool** is an object with the following:\r\n- `name:string`: the name of the tool. Required.\r\n- `commands:Array<Command>`: The commands that are supported by the tool. Only tools with at least 1 command can be mapped. Required.\r\n- `auth:Array<string>`: Used for user-name based authorization. Only the specificed users may access the tool. Optional.\r\n\r\nA **command** has the following specification:\r\n- `name:string`: the name of the command. Required.\r\n- `invoke(tool?: ITool, robot?: any, res?: any, match?: RegExpMatchArray): void`: Called when the command is invoked. The parameters show the scope in which the command was called. The match contains captured information. Required.\r\n- `auth:Array<string>`: A list of usernames that will be used to authorize access to the command. Optional.\r\n- `capture:string`: A regex that can be used to match values behind a command. Optional.\r\n- `alias:Array<string>`: A list of aliases of the command. Can be used to support multiple names to trigger the command like: `[\"del\", \"rm\"]`. An empty alias is also possible to add default commands to tools. Optional.\r\n- `auth:Array<string>`: Used for user-name based authorization. Only the specificed users may access the command. Optional.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThe tool also supports the reload of tools that have commands in different files like this:\r\n```\r\nconst mapper = require(\"hubot-command-mapper\"),\r\n  connector = require(\"./norris/connector.js\"),\r\n  cmdImpersonate = require(\"./norris/impersonate.js\"),\r\n  cmdNr = require(\"./norris/nr.js\"),\r\n  cmdRandom = require(\"./norris/random.js\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = robot => {\r\n  mapper(robot, {\r\n    name: \"norris\",\r\n    connector: connector,\r\n    commands: [cmdRandom, cmdNr, cmdImpersonate]\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Happy coding!_\r\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
