These triggers have a fairly broad scope, so expect collisions if you're using this.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-gerty --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-gerty** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-gerty\"\n]\n```\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nSam>> go away hubot\nhubot>> I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
