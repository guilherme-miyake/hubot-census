hubot-github-pull-requests [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-github-pull-requests.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-github-pull-requests)\n\nA script for Hubot to show open pull requests on GitHub for repos you own/have access to and care about.\n\n\n## Install\n\nAdd the node package to the hubot dependencies in `package.json`\n\n```bash\n$ npm install hubot-github-pull-requests --save\n```\n\nAdd hubot-github-pull-requests to `external-scripts.json`\n\n```javascript\n[\"hubot-github-pull-requests\"]\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n> hubot pr\n> # List of Pull Requests from GitHub...\n> hubot prs\n> # List of Pull Requests from GitHub...\n```\n\nYou will need to set a few environment variables:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_PRS_GHE_API_URL = # (Optional) If you use a hosted GitHub Enterprise server, this is your v3 API URL. (E.g. github.yourdomain.com/api/v3)\nGITHUB_PRS_OAUTH_TOKEN = # (Required) A GitHub OAuth token generated from your account.\nGITHUB_PRS_USER = # (Required if GITHUB_PRS_TEAM_ID is not set) A GitHub username.\nGITHUB_PRS_TEAM_ID = # (Required if GITHUB_PRS_USER is not set) A GitHub Team ID returned from GitHub's API. Takes precendence over GITHUB_PRS_USER.\nGITHUB_PRS_REPO_OWNER_FILTER = # (Optional) A string that contains the names of users you'd like to filter by. (Helpful when you have a lot of forks on your repos that you don't care about.)\n```\n\n### For Help Finding a/your GitHub Team ID(s) (thanks [@davedash](https://github.com/davedash))\nhttp://fabian-kostadinov.github.io/2015/01/16/how-to-find-a-github-team-id/\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© David Posey\n","maintainers":[{"name":"helious","email":"rangemonk@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-18T22:53:04.813Z","created":"2015-11-13T15:38:27.163Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-13T15:38:27.163Z","1.0.1":"2015-11-13T15:57:27.201Z","1.1.0":"2015-11-13T18:54:53.148Z","1.1.1":"2015-11-13T18:59:34.468Z","1.2.0":"2016-05-09T23:33:25.524Z","1.3.0":"2016-05-20T18:28:16.507Z","1.3.1":"2016-06-15T00:36:54.570Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helious/hubot-github-pull-requests#readme","keywords":["github","pr","prs","pull-request","pull-requests","pull request","pull requests","hubot","hubot-scripts","github-pull-requests"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/helious/hubot-github-pull-requests.git"},"author":{"name":"David Posey","url":"https://github.com/helious"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helious/hubot-github-pull-requests/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","contributors":[{"name":"Dave Dash","url":"https://github.com/davedash"}],"users":{"jeremygaither":true},"_attachments":{}}
