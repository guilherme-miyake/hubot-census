We needed it to work seamlessly with\nPlaybook extensions and some other features that are still being considered for\nHubot's future, but we needed them today. This project may evolve into something\nnew or possibly return something to Hubot core. It will take more of a 'move\nfast and break things' approach, but contributions and discussion are very\nwelcome.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Make `generator-nubot`.\n- Update references to Hubot with Nubot.\n- Update E2E test and environment loaders with new scripts.\n- Update Express version.\n- Replace logger with Winston, integrated with Morgan for Express logs.\n- Unify docs for Nubot, Playbook, Pretend, Conditioner.\n- Update Roadmap with selected Hubot Evolution features (like multiple adapter support).\n\n## License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file for license rights and limitations (MIT).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"timkinnane","email":"tim@nestedcode.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-09-06T13:26:23.856Z","created":"2017-09-06T13:26:23.856Z","0.0.0-development":"2017-09-06T13:26:23.856Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubotio/hubot#readme","keywords":["github","nubot","hubot","chatbot","bot","campfire","slack","irc","rocket.chat","bot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/hubotio/hubot.git"},"author":{"name":"PropertyUX"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
