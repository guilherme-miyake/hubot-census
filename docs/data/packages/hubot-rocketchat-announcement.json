hubot-rocketchat-announcement\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]\n\nHubot script to send direct message announcements to Rocket.Chat users.\n\nSee [`src/rocketchat-announcement.coffee`](src/rocketchat-announcement.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n## CAUTION\n\nThis is a pre-release alpha version, not suitable for production environments.\n\nThis package requires [rocketchat-bot-helpers](https://github.com/timkinnane/rocketchat-bot-helpers/) package added to\nRocket.Chat. That is an experimental package, not published to Meteor and must be manually installed.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-rocketchat-announcement --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-rocketchat-announcement** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-rocketchat-announcement\"]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nNone at present.\n\nFeature roadmap will introduce ability to configure announcement levels and authentication.\nAt present levels are `ALERT`, `NOTICE`, `UPDATE`, `SOCIAL`.\n\nUsers will be able to reply to ignore future announcements per level, apart from ALERT.\nAuthentication for senders of announcements will allow permissions based on level.\n\ne.g. Only admins can send ALERT, moderators can send NOTICE/UPDATE, users can send SOCIAL.\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n### Immediate send\n\nUse announcement level (e.g. ALERT) to send immediately.\n\n`user1>> hubot ALERT Don't eat the blue cupcakes!`\n\nSends to all users (including user1)...\n\n```\nhubot>> Don't eat the blue cupcakes!\n        ALERT sent by @user1\n```\n\n### Dialog send\n\nUse NEW (optionally with level) to [start dialog](https://github.com/lmarkus/hubot-conversation) to produce announcements.\n\nThis method intended to handle more complicated announcements in roadmap, e.g. scheduling and user group targets.\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot NEW\nhubot>> @admin OK, I'll create a NOTICE from your next message.\n        Reply with the message you'd like to send (or `cancel` within 30 seconds).\nuser1>> Don't eat the blue cupcakes!\n```\n\nSends to all users...\n\n```\nhubot>> Don't eat the blue cupcakes!\n        NOTICE sent by @user1\n```\n\nWith level:\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot NEW UPDATE\nhubot>> @admin OK, I'll create a NOTICE from your next message.\n        Reply with the message you'd like to send (or `cancel` within 30 seconds).\nuser1>> You may eat the pink cupcakes.\n```\n\nSends to all users...\n\n```\nhubot>> You may eat the pink cupcakes.\n        UPDATE sent by @user1\n```\n\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/hubot-rocketchat-announcement\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/hubot-rocketchat-announcement.svg?style=flat\n","maintainers":[{"name":"timkinnane","email":"tim@nestedcode.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-28T05:58:44.394Z","created":"2016-06-23T04:04:20.478Z","0.0.0":"2016-06-23T04:04:20.478Z","0.0.1":"2016-06-23T17:26:00.896Z","0.0.2":"2016-06-24T06:10:32.612Z","0.0.3":"2016-07-01T07:17:03.307Z","0.1.0":"2016-07-28T05:58:44.394Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/timkinnane/hubot-rocketchat-announcement#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","rocketchat","Rocket.Chat"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/timkinnane/hubot-rocketchat-announcement.git"},"author":{"name":"Tim Kinnane","email":"tim@nestedcode.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/timkinnane/hubot-rocketchat-announcement/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
