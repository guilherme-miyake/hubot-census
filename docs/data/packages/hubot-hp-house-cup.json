I'm so sorry! Would you please log an issue here on Github so this module can be improved?\n\n## Roadmap\n- Yo: most of the code in this repo is stubbed out from yeoman, but I want to take a pass and ensure that it is as local organic artisanal as I want it to be\n- Actual tests: should be able to make changes, run tests, and feel confident in pushing new versions\n- More complex Regex: this module should capture more natural language forms of adding and removing points\n- Reasons: this module should be able to store and retrieve reasons for why points were added and removed\n","maintainers":[{"name":"trvra","email":"trevor.s.adams@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-04-08T04:26:16.882Z","created":"2015-03-15T02:41:56.781Z","0.0.0":"2015-03-15T02:41:56.781Z","0.0.1":"2015-04-08T04:26:16.882Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-hp-house-cup","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-hp-house-cup.git"},"author":{"name":"Trevor Adams","email":"trevor.s.adams@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-hp-house-cup/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
