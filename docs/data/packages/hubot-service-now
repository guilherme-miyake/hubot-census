For example, `devtest` of `devtest.service-now.com`|\n|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_DOMAIN`|Use instead of `HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_INSTANCE`; used to override the full FQDN used to connect to Service Now, useful for internal proxies|\n|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_USER`|User with API access rights|\n|`HUBOT_SERVICE_NOW_PASSWORD`|Password associated with above user|\n\n### Testing\nThis repository has a Gruntfile that describes a `test` task, which can be used for testing. The script is tested with `chai`, `nock`, and `hubot-test-helper`, and all new features should have associated tests, before the feature is released.\nTo test the script, run `grunt test` from the repository root.\n\n## Sample Interaction\n```\nuser1>> hubot snow INC0000001\nhubot>>\nFound INC0000001:\nShort Description: The hamburger has been stolen\nAssigned to: Hamburger Recovery\nOpened By: Ian Ward\nOpened At: 1970-01-01 00:00:00\nPriority: 1\nState: Work in Progress\n```\n\n## Implicit/Explicit Listen Toggle\nBy default, hubot will only listen for explicit requests (a channel/group mention or direct message, plus the trigger phrase: sn, snow, service now). However, you can optionally enable implicit operation on a per-channel basis. This relies on persistence via a hubot brain (hubot-redis-brain is the only one tested).\nThis per-channel toggle is triggered by the trigger phrase (case insensitive: sn, snow, service now), plus \"listen\".\n\nA sample interaction is as follows:\n```\nuser1>> INC0000001\nuser1>> Bill, please work on INC0000001\nuser1>> hubot service now listen\nhubot>> I will listen for Service Now\nuser1>> INC0000001\nhubot>>\nFound INC0000001:\nShort Description: The hamburger has been stolen\nAssigned to: Hamburger Recovery\nOpened By: Ian Ward\nOpened At: 1970-01-01 00:00:00\nPriority: 1\nState: Work in Progress\nuser1>> Bob, please work on INC0000002 for me.\nhubot>>\nFound INC0000002:\nShort Description: The hamburger recovery team has gotten lost in a health foods store\nAssigned to: Hamburger Recovery Recovery\nOpened By: Ian Ward\nOpened At: 1970-01-02 00:00:00\nPriority: 1\nState: Work in Progress\nuser1>> hubot service now listen\nhubot>> I won't listen for Service Now\nuser1>> INC0000001\n<no reponse>\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"iancward","email":"ian.ward@disney.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-01-12T15:47:17.641Z","created":"2017-01-12T15:42:48.355Z","1.0.1":"2017-01-12T15:42:48.355Z","1.0.0":"2017-01-12T15:46:28.989Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/disney/hubot-service-now#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/disney/hubot-service-now.git"},"author":{"name":"Ian C.
