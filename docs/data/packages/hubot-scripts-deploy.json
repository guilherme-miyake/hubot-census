What if you would never have to leave Slack to start & monitor a deploy?  \nYou can do that :).  \n\n(I know you know you can do everything, I just want to make our lives easier by writing the code.)\n\n### Jenkins & Slack use case\n\n```gherkin\nScenario: Deploy the application food-ordering on the development environment from Slack\nGiven I have an application named *food-ordering*\nAnd I have 3 Jenkins jobs to deploy the application, one for each environment: dev, staging and production\nAnd The Jenkins job name for deploying the app on dev is *DeployFoodOrderingDev*\nWhen I write in Slack: *@hubot deploy food-ordering on dev*\nThen the *DeployFoodOrderingDev* job will start.\n```\n\n## Benefits of solving the problem\n\nUsing a Hubot command in Slack to test, deploy, build or whatever you want to do, has the following benefits:\n\n- it will give your team the opportunity to have events logs in one place: inside a Slack channel.   \n- you will know if someone is deploying the app or if a test suite has failed,\n- you will be able to parametrized your deploy job with a given git branch, without having to click twice in Jenkins,\n- you won't have to browse trough dozens of jobs on your Jenkins instance, or to remember which job does what.\n\n## Solution ingredients\n\nYou need:\n 1. A Jenkins/Bamboo (CI tool) job to deploy your application\n 2. A communication tool, let's say Slack\n 3. A Hubot instance (the funny bot from GitHub)\n 4. Nice to have: Jenkins integrated with Slack\n\n\nYes, you can create a Slack command to trigger a Jenkins job, but I think it's easier to   \ncustomize and manage your tasks with these scripts.   \n\nIf you're reading this then you should already have 1, 2 at least, and maybe 4.   \nIf you don't, you should start with those: A CI tool, a communication channel and connect them.   \n\nTo move forward create a [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) instance, if you don't already have one.\n\n\n## How\n\n  1. Installation\n    - Add to your Hubot repository, in `package.json` the `hubot-scripts-deploy` package or via `npm install hubot-scripts-deploy --save`\n    - Enable the script by adding `\"hubot-scripts-deploy\"` to your  `external-scripts.json` file, in your Hubot project.\n\n  2. Configuration\n    - Configure the job in Jenkins to be triggered from a script, use [Build Token Root Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Token+Root+Plugin) for this.  \n    - In order to map the appropriate command with its CI job, we have to define a JSON for each script we want to use.  \n      Create a JSON file, in a directory wherever on your Hubot server's local storage, or even in the git project of your Hubot instance, with the following format:\n\n  ```json\n  \n  {\n    \"<nameOfYourProject>\": {\n      \"<environment1>\": \"<theJenkinsJobName>\",\n      \"<environment2>\": \"<theJenkinsJobName>\"\n    }\n  }\n  \n  ```\n\n     For a better understanding & examples, please check [data_example](data_example/) files. The [data_example/jenkins_deploy.json](data_example/jenkins_deploy.json) file  \n     describes a mapping between CI jobs and Hubot deploy commands, which are coded in the [jenkins/deploy.coffee](src/scripts/jenkins/deploy.coffee) script.  \n\n     !*Disclaimer*: The codebase and data are split for the each command type / script, to enable a better scope separation.\n\n    - Create a `config.coffee` file like [config.coffee.example](config.coffee.example) and add the needed settings:\n      - *JENKINS_URL* - the URL of your Jenkins master instance, with port and user & password (if set). Keep in mind that the URL must be accessible from the server on which you run your Hubot instance.\n      - *HUBOT_DEPLOY_TOKEN* - Jenkins Token for triggering the build remote, it might not be set\n      - *HUBOT_DEPLOY_DATA_FILE_PATH* - the absolute path to the JSON file created for the mapping of the commands.\n\n  3. Use\n\n   Now you can go in any Slack channel where Hubot is a member of, or even in a direct   message with him, and type commands like:\n\n   ```\n   @hubot (ci|cd) help\n   ```\n   to see extra help\n   \n   ```\n   @hubot (ci|cd) view rules\n   ```\n   to see the content of *HUBOT_DEPLOY_DATA_FILE_PATH*\n   \n   ```\n   @hubot (ci|cd) <nameOfYourProject> on <environment1>\n   ```\n   to start the job specified, in your the JSON file, at the *environment1* key of the *nameOfYourProject* entry.\n\n   or\n   ```\n   @hubot ci <nameOfYourProject2> on <environment1> with branch=staging region=us-east-1\n   ```\n   to start the job parametrized with the *staging* as the git branch and region.\n   \n   ! You should configure beforehand your job to accept the parameter at build.\n\n\n### Thank you\n\nI hope you find these scripts useful. If you have a success story, update or a complaint,   \nplease create an issue and let me know. :)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"marianitadn","email":"maria.nita.dn@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-11-23T21:39:21.227Z","created":"2016-07-26T12:10:54.713Z","0.0.1":"2016-07-26T12:10:54.713Z","0.0.2":"2016-07-26T12:49:43.714Z","0.0.3":"2016-07-26T15:36:58.343Z","0.0.4":"2016-07-26T16:00:51.925Z","0.0.5":"2016-07-27T11:44:24.011Z","0.0.6":"2016-07-27T12:34:04.341Z","0.0.7":"2016-07-27T12:57:51.193Z","0.1.0":"2017-11-22T07:21:56.544Z","0.1.1":"2017-11-23T18:46:16.655Z","0.1.2":"2017-11-23T19:55:31.864Z","0.2.0":"2017-11-23T20:27:53.236Z","0.2.1":"2017-11-23T20:39:47.512Z","0.2.2":"2017-11-23T20:46:06.118Z","0.2.3":"2017-11-23T20:51:23.521Z","0.2.4":"2017-11-23T21:11:58.995Z","0.2.5":"2017-11-23T21:39:21.227Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/maria/hubot-scripts-deploy#README.md","keywords":["hubot","deploy","ci"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/maria/hubot-scripts-deploy.git"},"author":{"name":"Maria Nita"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/maria/hubot-scripts-deploy/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"ggyax":true}}
