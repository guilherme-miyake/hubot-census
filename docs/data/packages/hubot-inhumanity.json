You should buy it if you like it.\n\n## Thanks!\n\nOriginally forked from https://github.com/jakswa/hubot-humanity\nI prefer js to coffee so I converted it to js, massively increased the db, added functionality to choose different sets, changed syntax, and had it auto fill blanks in questions cards.\n\n## Usage\n\n`hubot cah q card`, to load a question (black) card\n`hubot cah draw` to draw asnwer (white) cards and fill in the blanks.\n`hubot cah sets` will list the available packs. defaulting to use them all\n`hubot cah use <setindex>` will specify use of a single CAH pack. No support for multiple yet.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the package `hubot-inhumanity` as a dependency in your Hubot package.json file. Then add `hubot-inhumanity` to the list in the `external-scripts.json` file.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"dannyshaw","email":"dannyshaw.pub@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-05-01T13:11:44.586Z","created":"2016-05-01T08:38:06.899Z","1.0.0":"2016-05-01T08:38:06.899Z","1.0.1":"2016-05-01T13:11:44.586Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dannyshaw/hubot-inhumanity#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/dannyshaw/hubot-inhumanity.git"},"author":{"name":"Danny Shaw","email":"github@dannyshaw.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dannyshaw/hubot-inhumanity/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
