If no \ndefault category is specified, no category will be used unless specified by the user. If a locale is not specified, \nthe script is hard-coded to use `en_US` as the default locale.\n\nTo see if a locale that you need is supported, check Yelp Fusion's [list of supported locales](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/supported_locales).\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\nThe hubot-yelp script will allow your hubot to look up different kinds of food for you. By using `hubot lunchtime`, hubot\nwill find a random place to eat using the default location:\n\n```\n<You> hubot lunchtime\n<hubot> Give this place a shot:\n<hubot> Novel Restaurant\n<hubot> Yelp rating: 4.5\n<hubot> Total reviews: 133\n<hubot> http://www.yelp.com/biz/novel-restaurant-kansas-city\n```\n\nThis script makes it possible to specify any location to find food. Type `hubot lunchtime thats ` \nto call the script, then specify a category of food:\n\n```\n<You>hubot lunchtime thats bbq\n<hubot> Give this place a shot:\n<hubot> BRGR Kitchen + Bar\n<hubot> Yelp rating: 4\n<hubot> Total reviews: 165\n<hubot> http://www.yelp.com/biz/brgr-kitchen-bar-kansas-city\n```\n\nThe lunchtime script will randomly select a place that matches the category you specified, and print out the name of the place,\nthe rating out of 5 on Yelp, how many reviews the place has been given by Yelp users, and a link to the Yelp website containing \nreviews, directions, hours of operation, and more.\n\nIf you'd rather not specify a category and would rather find a place near a certain location, you can specify that \nby typing `hubot lunchtime near ` and specifying a location:\n\n```\n<You> hubot lunchtime near Las Vegas, NV\n<hubot> Give this place a shot:\n<hubot> Fountains of Bellagio\n<hubot> Yelp rating: 4.5\n<hubot> Total reviews: 940\n<hubot> http://www.yelp.com/biz/fountains-of-bellagio-las-vegas\n```\n\nThe script also allows you to specify a place and a category by typing `hubot lunchtime near <place> thats <category>`:\n\n```\n<You> hubot lunchtime near 99206 thats seafood\n<hubot> Give this place a shot:\n<hubot> Ivar's Seafood Bars\n<hubot> Yelp rating: 3\n<hubot> Total reviews: 1\n<hubot> http://www.yelp.com/biz/ivars-seafood-bars-spokane\n```\n\n## Powered by\n\n[YelpV3 by danieljin](https://github.com/danieljin/yelpv3)\n\n[![Yelp](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/developer_pages/65526d1a519b/assets/img/Powered_By_Yelp_Red.png)](https://www.yelp.com/developers)\n\n[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)\n\n[Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jvarness","email":"jake.varness@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-08-05T17:57:16.267Z","created":"2015-10-25T23:49:52.041Z","0.0.1":"2015-10-25T23:49:52.041Z","0.0.2":"2015-10-25T23:55:57.316Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-29T02:41:54.936Z","0.1.1":"2015-10-30T02:06:08.114Z","0.1.2":"2015-11-26T01:12:49.724Z","0.1.3":"2016-02-08T16:08:57.505Z","0.2.0":"2017-07-10T19:45:06.341Z","0.2.1":"2017-08-05T17:57:16.267Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jvarness/hubot-yelp#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jvarness/hubot-yelp.git"},"author":{"name":"Jake Varness","email":"jake.varness@gmail.com","url":"http://github.com/jvarness"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jvarness/hubot-yelp/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"eric1599":true},"_attachments":{}}
