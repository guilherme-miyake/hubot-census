If it's AM, they get times for their buses heading into the office.  Likewise, if it's PM, they get times for buses that will take them home.\n\n**NOTE:** RadBus currently only works in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN) area.\n\n## Installation\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-radbus.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-radbus/)\n\nIn your Hubot repository, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-radbus --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-radbus** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-radbus\"]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n`RadBus` requires a bit of configuration to get everything working:\n\n* **HUBOT_RADBUS_TIMEZONE** - Set to `America/Chicago` since RadBus only supports the Twin Cities metro area, which is in the Chicago timezone\n* **HUBOT_RADBUS_API_BASE_URL** - Set to `https://api.radbus.io/v1`\n* **HUBOT_RADBUS_API_KEY** - Set to the an API key that has been registered to your instance of Hubot.  Go [here](https://github.com/RadBus/api/wiki/Client-Authentication#obtaining-your-api-key) for more information on how to request an API key.\n\n## Commands\n\n```\nhubot bus token {token} - Sets your application token (refresh token) so Hubot can call the RadBus API from the server-side on your behalf.\nhubot bus me [route] - Returns your upcoming bus schedule (to work if its AM, to home if PM).  Optionally you can specify a route and it will only reply with departures from that route.\nhubot bus {user} [route] - Same as 'bus me' but for a different Hubot user.\n```\n\n- Before `bus me` will return anything useful, it needs to know your bus schedule.  The easiest way to do that is to go build your personalized schedule using a RadBus app (for example: https://www.radbus.io).\n- Before Hubot will be allowed to make API calls on behalf of your user you need to aquire an application token (otherwise known as a 'refresh token') and register it with Hubot (see `bus token` command above).  If you don't have a registered application token, Hubot will tell you what you need to do to get one.\n\n## Example Interactions\n\n```\nbusrider> hubot bus me\nhubot> Hey @busrider, give me a moment to look up those bus depatures...\n       @busrider, here are your next bus times:\n       7:23 AM (1 minuteundefined): 264-C @ I-35W and County Rd C Park & Ride\n         http://goo.gl/WHgnd7\n       7:39 AM (17 minutes): 264-C @ I-35W and County Rd C Park & Ride\n         http://goo.gl/WbGdCc\n       7:57 AM (35 minutes): 264-C @ I-35W and County Rd C Park & Ride\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n* http://dev.radbus.io\n","maintainers":[{"name":"twistedstream","email":"peter@twistedstream.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-12-18T18:17:12.270Z","created":"2014-12-18T06:12:29.908Z","0.2.0":"2014-12-18T06:12:29.908Z","0.2.6":"2014-12-18T18:17:12.270Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/RadBus/hubot-radbus","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","RadBus","API"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/RadBus/hubot-radbus.git"},"author":{"name":"twistedstream"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/RadBus/hubot-radbus/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
