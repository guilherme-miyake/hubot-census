see https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments\n    text: \"Attachment text\"\n    fallback: \"Attachment fallback\"\n    fields: [{\n      title: \"Field title\"\n      value: \"Field value\"\n    }]\n  channel: \"#general\" # optional, defaults to message.room\n  username: \"foobot\" # optional, defaults to robot.name\n  icon_url: \"...\" # optional\n  icon_emoji: \"...\" # optional\n```\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* The user name sending the attachment will be `#{robot.name} (bot)`, so if your bot is named `hubot` it will appear as `hubot (bot)`\n\n[hubot-slack]: https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack\n[incoming]: https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe following people deserve as much credit as I do for contributing to make this little project better:\n\n* [Kevin Ballard](https://github.com/kballard)\n* [Bojan Rajkovic](https://github.com/bojanrajkovic)\n* [Ivan Buryak](https://github.com/11bit)\n\n## License\nThis software is licensed under MIT License.
