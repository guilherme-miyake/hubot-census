This scratches our itch quite well when working for a client through a middleman. Most agencies use Harvest, like us, for time tracking and invoicing.\n\nThe problem this plugin solves is quite precise and the implementation is as well so it may not be useful to you. Here are the details:\n\n* Only supports one-way synchronisation from your Harvest account other Harvest accounts.\n* Supports syncing project to project (1-to-1 for now), task to task, or all tasks to one task.\n* Uses the saved credentials of your chat user to query timesheets to sync. Needs to be admin.\n* Uses global saved credentials for external accounts, to query and save changes on the other side.\n* Only one Harvest user for each external Harvest domain. Does not need to have admin access there. This user will own all synced hours on the other side.\n\n## Setup\n\nIn your hubot-config folder, install this script:\n\n```bash\nnpm i hubot-harvest-sync --save\n```\n\nAdd this script to your `external-scripts.json` file in the root of the config folder like this:\n\n```bash\n[\"hubot-harvest-sync\"]\n```\n\nThen restart or redeploy your hubot. \n\n## Use\n\nAfter setup, just chat with your hubot:\n\n```\n# Configure source account. Admin. Associated with your chat user. \nhubot remember my harvest account <email> with password <password>\n\n# Register one or more target accounts by Harvest subdomain.\nhubot remember a harvest migration account <email> with password <password> at <harvest-subdomain>\n\n# Configure one or more project/task mappings. Supports fuzzy project/task matching. Default task values is to sync all source tasks with a target task with \"dev\" in the name.\nhubot remember a harvest migration from <project>[/<task>] to <project>[/<task>] at <harvest-subdomain>\n\n# Perform a timesheet migration. Defaults to syncing the last 7 days.\nhubot migrate [<num> days of ]<harvest-subdomain> harvest\n```\n\nExample hubot response after a migration:\n\n```\nMigrated 23.42 Project A hours to agency-1.\nMigrated 2.42 Project B hours to agency-1.\nDeleted 0.42 Project C hours from agency-1.\nProject D is already in sync with agency-1.\nMigrated 12.32 Project E hours to agency-2.\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Aranja.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
