hubot-zerocater-lunch [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-zerocater-lunch.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-zerocater-lunch)\n\nA [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) plugin to query the ZeroCater API to see what's for lunch.\n\nIt does not know when lunch has been delivered, but all it takes is one person to say \"lunch\"\nin a channel where your Hubot is listening.\n\n### Usage\n\n    lunch - Display what's for lunch\n    hubot what's for lunch\n    hubot what's for lunch tomorrow?\n\n### Screenshot (textual irc)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/145113/10709293/d5db8082-79db-11e5-89c8-5487b7599c5f.png)\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou'll need your four character ZeroCater tag.  Visit your ZeroCater menu and it'll\nbe at the end of the URL: https://zerocater.com/m/[TAG-HERE].\n\nPut that tag in the environment variable ZEROCATER_TAG. \n\n### Installation (old style):\n\nPlace lunch.coffee to your hubot/scripts directory. Restart hubot.\n\n### Installation (new style):\n\n1. cd into your hubot dir, run `npm install --save hubot-zerocater-lunch` (adds a dependency in package.json).\n2. Add `\"hubot-zerocater-lunch\"` to your `external-scripts.json` file.\n3. Restart Hubot.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"notpeter","email":"petertripp@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-02-17T21:34:18.846Z","created":"2015-10-02T21:34:27.870Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-02T21:34:27.870Z","1.0.1":"2015-10-02T21:46:32.073Z","1.0.2":"2015-10-16T18:19:59.797Z","1.0.3":"2016-02-17T21:07:19.126Z","1.0.4":"2016-02-17T21:34:18.846Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/notpeter/hubot-zerocater-lunch","keywords":["hubot","lunch","zerocater"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/notpeter/hubot-zerocater-lunch.git"},"author":{"name":"Peter Tripp","url":"https://github.com/notpeter"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/notpeter/hubot-zerocater-lunch/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
