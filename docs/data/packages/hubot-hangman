Hangman using Wordnik and Hubot!\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-hangman.png?downloads=true&&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-hangman/) [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/hubot-hangman.png?months=3&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-hangman/)\n\nA coffee-script based chat add-on for playing Hangman. The script originated in the hubot-scripts repo. The hubot-scripts repo was later deprecated in favor of using stand alone node_modules for each hubot add-on. Seeing as the hangman.coffee script had not been touched or modified in several years and the originator of the script did not have a repo with anything related to hangman, I opted to port this and keep it maintained with the MIT license.\n\nPlease feel free to leave any feedback on the github project.\n\nThe script requires a Wordnik API key which you will need to request and setup as a CONFIG_VAR on Heroku. The API keys are free to request. http://developer.wordnik.com/\n\nAPI\n---\n\n* `hubot hangman` - Display state of current game or start new game.\n* `hubot hangman {x}` - Make a single character guess.\n* `hubot hangman {word}` - Make a guess to solve the puzzle.\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command \n\n    $ npm install hubot-hangman\n\nThen to make sure the dependencies are installed:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nTo enable the script, add a `hubot-hangman` entry to the `external-scripts.json`\nfile (you may need to create this file).\n\n    [\"hubot-hangman\"]\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 1.3.1\n\n* Added `'` as a default guess. Now spaces, dashes, and apostrophes will not require guessing and will be shown in the word printout.\n* If you notice any other special characters causing problems please create an issue on the github project for me to address. \n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Fixed: [Issue #1](https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-hangman/issues/1)\n* Thanks to cpradio for finding another special character bug.\n* Updated the special characters to be defined as an array that we can expand in the future if necessary.\n* Now both spaces and dashes will be shown in the word. \n* Example: `This-is a-game` would now be shown as `? ? ? ? - ? ?   ? - ? ? ? ?`.\n* Happy guessing!\n\n\n### 1.2.1\n\n* 1.2.0 bug fix. \n* Dashes were considered guessed, but weren't shown as guessed characters.\n* Now dashes are shown in word. `The 8 letter word is: ? ? ? ? - ? ? ?`\n\n### 1.2.0\n\n* Added `-` as a default guess. Many users don't expect a dash to appear in the word and hence never guess special characters. \n* Dash will be given for free.\n* If you guess a `-` it will be treated as a previously guessed letter and will not count against you.\n* If the word contains a dash, it will be shown automatically.\n\n### 1.1.0\n\n* Bugfix: Changed unguessed character identifier from `-` to `?`. Some words in the WORDNIK api include dashes, this can confuse the game leaving you stuck in an eternal loop. Changing the character to a question mark to prevent this from happening in the future. `*`'s and `_`'s have been avoided due to markdown formatting used by many chat client apps.\n\n### 1.0.1\n\n* Updated tags for npmjs.com search\n\n### 1.0.0\n \n* Confirmed hubot-hangman script is not available as NPM package\n* Migrated hubot-hangman script into NPM package format\n* Changed unguessed character identifier from `_` to `-` to improve client formatting\n* Published npmjs.com\n","maintainers":[{"name":"kwandrews7","email":"kwandrews7@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-26T02:30:05.439Z","created":"2015-08-11T16:00:53.218Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-11T16:00:53.218Z","1.0.1":"2015-08-11T16:04:30.261Z","1.1.0":"2015-08-24T15:20:16.785Z","1.2.0":"2015-08-25T15:59:20.951Z","1.2.1":"2015-10-06T19:10:04.569Z","1.3.0":"2016-02-09T15:09:41.320Z","1.3.1":"2016-07-26T02:30:05.439Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-hangman#readme","keywords":["hubot","hangman","wordnik","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-hangman.git"},"author":{"name":"Kyle Andrews","email":"https://github.com/kwandrews7"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-hangman/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
