Hubot LDAP Authorization\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-ldap-auth.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-ldap-auth)\n\nThis module is derived from the [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth) module and it delegates the main functions of authorization to an LDAP server using the [ldapjs](http://ldapjs.org/client.html) LDAP client.  In the implementation, it is meant to be a drop in replacement for the existing module so that the other integrations that exist around hubot-auth can continue to function properly.  All modifying actions have been removed from the auth client so that the LDAP server can act as a service providing authorization details to Hubot, rather than providing Hubot ability to do such modifications.  Theoretically, this would be a separate script to do such an integration, but it is not in the scope of this module.\n\n## Configuration\n\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_LDAP_URL` - the URL to the LDAP server\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_BIND_DN` - the bind DN to authenticate with\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_BIND_PASSWORD` - the bind password to authenticate with\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_USER_SEARCH_FILTER` - the ldap filter search for a specific user - e.g. 'cn={0}' where '{0}' will be replaced by the hubot user attribute\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_ATTRIBUTE` - the member attribute within the user object\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_FILTER` - the membership filter to find groups based on user DN - e.g. 'member={0}' where '{0}' will be replaced by user DN\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_SEARCH_METHOD` - (filter | attribute) - how to find groups belong to users\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_ROLES_TO_INCLUDE` - comma separated group names that will be used as roles, all the rest of the groups will be filtered out\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_USE_ONLY_LISTENER_ROLES` - if true, groups will be filtered by all listener options, all the rest of the groups will be filtered out\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_SEARCH_BASE_DN` - search DN to start finding users and groups within the ldap directory\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_USER_LDAP_ATTRIBUTE` - the ldap attribute to match hubot users within the ldap directory\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_HUBOT_USER_ATTRIBUTE` - the hubot user attribute to search for a user within the ldap directory\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_GROUP_LDAP_ATTRIBUTE` - the ldap attribute of a group that will be used as role name\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_LDAP_REFRESH_TIME` - time in millisecods to refresh the roles and users\n* `HUBOT_LDAP_AUTH_DN_ATTRIBUTE_NAME` - the dn attribute name, used for queries by DN. In ActiveDirectory should be distinguishedName\n\n## Integration with Hubot\n\nThis script is meant to be used with the [hubot-auth-middleware](https://github.com/HelloFax/hubot-auth-middleware) project which uses the auth plugin in Hubot to determine whether a user can take a particular action.  See the [README.md](https://github.com/HelloFax/hubot-auth-middleware/blob/master/README.md) of that project for more details on configuring roles for user actions.\n\nIn order to set up this plugin, first install it in the project:\n\n    npm install hubot-ldap-auth --save\n\nThen, add the script to the `external-scripts.json` file:\n\n    [\n      \"hubot-ldap-auth\"\n    ]","maintainers":[{"name":"jmcshane","email":"jmcshan1@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-05-23T21:26:34.502Z","created":"2017-02-10T19:15:11.969Z","0.0.1":"2017-02-10T19:15:11.969Z","0.0.2":"2017-02-10T19:25:00.411Z","0.1.0":"2017-02-14T04:10:37.118Z","0.1.1":"2017-02-14T04:16:57.873Z","0.1.2":"2017-02-14T04:18:30.555Z","0.2.0":"2018-05-23T21:26:30.607Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jmcshane/hubot-ldap-auth#readme","keywords":["hubot","ldap","authorization","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jmcshane/hubot-ldap-auth.git"},"author":{"name":"jmcshane","email":"jmcshan1@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jmcshane/hubot-ldap-auth/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
