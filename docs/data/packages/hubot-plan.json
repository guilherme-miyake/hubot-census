hubot-plan\n\nPlan events with chatops :sparkles: :calendar:\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the hubot-plan package from npm and add it to your `package.json` file:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install hubot-plan\n```\n\nNow add the hubot-plan module to `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```\n$ cat external-scripts.json\n['hubot-plan']\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nNote that your hubot may have a different name or an alias. Commands are shown with a \"hubot:\" prefix for consistency. This package uses an [argument name parser for command-line tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) so it obeys many of the same conventions from shells like bash - double-dash `--arg`, quoting multi-word arguments with double-quotes or single-quotes.\n\n### Specifying dates\n\nEvent dates can be specified in [ISO-8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). You can specify only dates for full-day events (`2018-01-27`) or exact times (`2018-01-27T17:30`).\n\n### Creating events\n\nCreate new events with the `hubot: event create` command. Examples:\n\n* `hubot: event create --name \"Party at @frey's House\"`. Create an empty event.\n\n* `hubot: event create --name \"Party at @frey's House\" --at 2018-03-12`. Create an event with a known final date.\n\n* `hubot: event create --name \"Party at @frey's House\" --propose 2018-03-12T13:00 --propose 2018-03-17T14:00`. Create an event with two possible dates. Give others a chance to share their availability before choosing a final date.\n\nOther arguments:\n\n* `--invite @username`. Explicitly invite a user who you think would be interested in attending. Note that users don't need to be explicitly invited to respond to an event.\n\nOnce the event has been created, it will be assigned an _ID_ - a unique, alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the event, even if you create several with the same name.\n\n### Responding to invitations\n\nTo respond to an event that does not have a final date chosen:\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --yes 0` to indicate that you would be able to attend the proposed date with index 0.\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --yes 1 --yes 3` to indicate that you would be able to attend the proposed dates 1 and 3.\n\nTo respond to an event that has had a final date chosen:\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --yes` to say you can make it;\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --no` to say you can't.\n\n### Changing events\n\nTo modify an event after it's created, call `hubot: event` with the ID it's been assigned and other arguments. You can also use `hubot: event <id>` with no further arguments to view the current state of an event.\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --propose 2018-04-01T14:00`. Propose an additional date and time for the event. You may specify --propose more than once to propose more than one date at a time.\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --unpropose 2`. Remove a proposed date from the running by index. Note that the other proposed dates will remain with their original indices.\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --invite @username`. Invite an additional user to the event.\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --uninvite @username`. Remove an invited user from the event. (The user can still reply normally, but won't be @-mentioned when the event is shown.)\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --finalize 1`. Choose one of the event's proposed dates as its final date. Everyone who previously replied with `--yes 1` will automatically be converted to a \"yes\" for that date; everyone who responded with a different date will be converted to a \"no\".\n\n* `hubot: event ABC123 --unfinalize`. Reverse a finalization to allow you to pick a different date.\n\n### Listing events\n\nTo see existing events and their IDs:\n\n* `hubot: event list` defaults to showing events that have not yet occurred.\n\n* `hubot: event list --all` shows all events, even ones that have elapsed.\n\n* `hubot: event list --before 2018-01-01` shows events before a timestamp. `--after` works similarly.\n\n* `hubot: event list --finalized` shows only events that have had a final date chosen. `--unfinalized` shows events that have not yet had a final date chosen.\n\n* `hubot: event list --invited @username` shows only events that invite a specific username.\n\nSpecifying multiple filters at once shows events that match all criteria (so, it combines them with \"and\").\n\n### Deleting events\n\n* `hubot: event delete ABC123` to delete an event with ID ABC123.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"smashwilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-28T02:57:38.442Z","created":"2017-12-14T16:45:18.348Z","0.0.2":"2017-12-14T16:45:18.348Z","0.0.3":"2017-12-14T20:10:56.441Z","0.0.4":"2017-12-15T16:21:15.074Z","0.0.5":"2017-12-31T01:25:07.871Z","0.0.6":"2018-01-28T02:57:38.442Z"},"keywords":["hubot","events","calendar","planning"],"author":{"name":"Ash Wilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
