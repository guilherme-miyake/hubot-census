It was\ninitially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be\ndeployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.\n\nThis README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve\nto talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is\navailable, etc!\n\n[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com\n[hubot]: http://hubot.github.com\n[generator-hubot]: https://github.com/github/generator-hubot\n\n### Running hubot-servicenow Locally\n\nYou can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not\nbehave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely\nupon have been set.\n\nYou can start hubot-servicenow locally by running:\n\n    % bin/hubot\n\nYou'll see some start up output and a prompt:\n\n    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379\n\n### Configuration\n\nA few scripts (including some installed by default) require environment\nvariables to be set as a simple form of configuration.\n\nEach script should have a commented header which contains a \"Configuration\"\nsection that explains which values it requires to be placed in which variable.\nWhen you have lots of scripts installed this process can be quite labour\nintensive. The following shell command can be used as a stop gap until an\neasier way to do this has been implemented.\n\n    grep -o 'hubot-[a-z0-9_-]\\+' external-scripts.json | \\\n      xargs -n1 -I {} sh -c 'sed -n \"/^# Configuration/,/^#$/ s/^/{} /p\" \\\n          $(find node_modules/{}/ -name \"*.coffee\")' | \\\n        awk -F '#' '{ printf \"%-25s %s\\n\", $1, $2 }'\n\nHow to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.\nRather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,\nit's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.\n\n## Adapters\n\nAdapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on, such\nas Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party adapters that the\ncommunity have contributed. Check [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the\navailable ones.\n\nIf you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add\nthe adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the\n`dependencies` section.\n\nOnce you've added the dependency with `npm install --save` to install it you\ncan then run hubot with the adapter.\n\n    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>\n\nWhere `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Deployment\n\n    % heroku create --stack cedar\n    % git push heroku master\n\nIf your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable\nand add the Redis to Go addon to your app.\n\n    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano\n\nIf you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].\n\nYou'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.\n\nMore detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto\nHeroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.\n\n### Deploying to UNIX or Windows\n\nIf you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.\nPlease check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and [deploying\nhubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.\n\n[heroku-node-docs]: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js\n[deploy-heroku]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md\n[deploy-unix]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n[deploy-windows]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/windows.md\n\n## Restart the bot\n\nYou may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if\nyou're having issues.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"anthonypjshaw","email":"anthonyshaw@apache.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-20T02:02:53.456Z","created":"2016-06-17T06:14:47.914Z","0.1.0":"2016-06-17T06:14:47.914Z","0.2.0":"2016-06-20T01:55:50.815Z","0.3.0":"2016-06-20T02:02:53.456Z"},"author":{"name":"Anthony Shaw","email":"anthonyshaw@apache.org"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
