Hubot Factoids\n\nA factoids implementation for Hubot, inspired by [oftn-bot](https://github.com/oftn/oftn-bot).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-scripts/hubot-factoids.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-scripts/hubot-factoids)\n\n## Features\n\n* Supports [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth).\n* @mention support: factoid value will be directed at mentioned user.\n* Customizable prefix\n* Aliases: point a factoid at the value of another factoid.\n* Substitutive editing using sed-like syntax.\n* Factoid history: any time a new value is set on a factoid, the name of the\nuser, current date, previous value and new value are recorded\n* Factoid popularity: currently only visible in the raw data\n* HTTP route to view raw JSON factoid data.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install hubot-factoids`\n\n## Configuration\n\n`HUBOT_BASE_URL` _[required]_ - URL of Hubot (ex. http://myhubothost.com:5555/)\n\n`HUBOT_FACTOID_PREFIX` _[optional]_ - prefix character to use for retrieving a\nfactoid (defaults to `!` if unset)\n\n## Commands\n\n### Create/update a factoid\n\nCreates a new factoid if it doesn't exist, or overwrites the factoid value with\nthe new value. Factoids maintain a history (can be viewed via the factoid URL)\nof all past values along with who updated the value and when.\n\n> **Note:** `<factoid>` can be any string which does not contain `=` or `=~`\n(these reserved characters delimit the factoid and its value), although special\ncharacters should be avoided.\n\n`hubot: learn <factoid> = <details>`\n\n### Inline editing a factoid\n\nIf you prefer, you can edit a factoid value inline, using a sed-like substitution\nexpression.\n\n`hubot: learn <factoid> =~ s/expression/replace/gi`\n\n`hubot: learn <factoid> =~ s/expression/replace/i`\n\n`hubot: learn <factoid> =~ s/expression/replace/g`\n\n`hubot: learn <factoid> =~ s/expression/replace/`\n\n### Set an alias\n\nAn alias will point to the specified pre-existing factoid and when invoked will\nreturn that factoid's value.\n\n`hubot: alias <factoid> = <factoid>`\n\n### Forget a factoid\n\nDisables responding to a factoid. The factoid is not deleted from memory, and\ncan be re-enabled by setting a new value (its complete history is retained).\n\n`hubot: forget <factoid>`\n\n### Get URL to factoid data\n\nServes a page with the raw JSON output of the factoid data\n\n`hubot: factoids`\n\n### Recall a factoid value\n\nRecall the value of the given factoid.\n\n> **Note:** Hubot should not be directly addressed.\n\n`!<factoid>`\n\nCan be combined with a @mention to direct the message at another user:\n\n`!factoid @user`\n\nHubot will respond accordingly:\n\n`Hubot> @user: factoid value`\n\n### Search for a factoid\n\nFind a factoid containing the given string. The string can be matched in either\nthe factoid key or value.\n\n`hubot: search foobar`\n\n\n### Drop a factoid\n\n**Permanently removes a factoid—this action cannot be undone.**\nIf [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth) script is loaded,\n\"admin\" or \"factoids-admin\" role is required to perform this action. It's\nrecommended you use the `forget` command instead of `drop`.\n\n`hubot: drop <factoid>`\n","maintainers":[{"name":"therealklanni","email":"therealklanni@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-07-31T22:02:47.198Z","created":"2014-05-20T07:19:42.158Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-20T07:19:42.158Z","0.1.1":"2014-05-22T05:34:15.225Z","0.2.0":"2014-05-22T06:16:14.777Z","0.2.1":"2014-06-04T04:04:58.418Z","0.2.3":"2014-06-13T06:23:46.322Z","0.2.4":"2014-08-30T20:34:30.543Z","0.2.5":"2015-02-06T09:01:25.281Z","0.2.6":"2015-02-17T03:11:37.679Z","0.2.7":"2015-07-16T04:25:43.443Z","1.0.0":"2016-07-07T04:26:54.404Z","1.0.1":"2017-01-04T00:01:37.890Z","1.1.0":"2017-03-24T22:08:13.976Z","1.2.0":"2017-07-31T22:02:47.198Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/therealklanni/hubot-factoids#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","factoids"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/therealklanni/hubot-factoids.git"},"author":{"name":"Kevin Lanni","email":"therealklanni@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/therealklanni"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/therealklanni/hubot-factoids/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"sinisterstuf":true}}
