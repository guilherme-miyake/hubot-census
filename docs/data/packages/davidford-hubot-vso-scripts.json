In this mode the user has to explicitly\r\n  authorize hubot\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo install, in your Hubot instance directory\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install hubot-vso-scripts\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nInclude the package in your hubot's external-scripts.json\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\"hubot-vso-scripts\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Upgrade from 0.2.5 or previous version\r\n\r\nIf you are using impersonate mode (OAuth), you will need to re-register your application on Visual Studio Online.\r\n\r\nThis is needed, because version 1.0 has introduced a more granular scope and we now request\r\nless permissions\r\n\r\nYou will need to register the application with the following permissions\r\n\r\n + Work items (read and write)\r\n + Build (read and execute)\r\n + Code (read)\r\n\r\nThen you need to update you environment variables with your app id and your app secret (authorize URL stays the same)\r\n\r\nThe scripts will automatically detect the situation and ask the users to (re) authorize hubot scripts.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nThe required environment variables are\r\n\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_ACCOUNT** - The Visual Studio Online account's name\r\n\r\nMessage replies are by default sent in plaintext, but if your adapter is capable of receiving messanges in other\r\nformat you can configure the scripts to use a different formatting\r\n\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_REPLY\\_FORMAT** The formatting of replies. You can use plaintext,html or markdown\r\n\r\n*Trust Mode*\r\n\r\nIn trust mode we need to set the alternate credentials of the user who  will perform the tasks\r\n\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_USERNAME**: The alternate credentials username\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_PASSWORD**: The alternate credentials password\r\n\r\n*Impersonate Mode*\r\n\r\nIn impersonate we need to set the variables defined in the application registered in Visual Studio Online\r\n(Click [here](http://www.visualstudio.com/integrate/get-started-auth-oauth2-vsi) to know how to register an\r\napplication in Visual Studio Online\r\n\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_APP\\_ID**: The application ID\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_APP\\_SECRET**: The application secret\r\n+ **HUBOT\\_VSONLINE\\_AUTHORIZATION\\_CALLBACK\\_URL**: The OAuth callback URL.
