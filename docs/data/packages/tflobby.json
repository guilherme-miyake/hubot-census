[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skibz/tflobby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skibz/tflobby)\n-------\n\n##### abstract\n\nthis module was designed to play nicely with [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot). it's pretty easy to set up and use for your own chat bot and team fortress game servers.\n\nadding and configuring the `hubot-auth` script is recommended if you plan on using this module with (or without) rcon capability. in fact, this script assumes you've assigned `admin`, `officer` and `rcon` roles. let's face it, if you're going to provide a public lobby system, you don't want any old tom, dick or harry playing with your rcon commands or cancelling your lobby while it's still waiting for players.\n\n##### configuration\n\nrefer to [`src/index.coffee`](https://github.com/skibz/tflobby/blob/master/src/index.coffee) for configuration information.\n\nthis module is yours to do with **as you please** - public domain, muddafuckas.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"skibz","email":"antony@mycosentino.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-02-04T17:56:12.216Z","created":"2014-11-06T17:10:18.318Z","0.0.0":"2014-11-06T17:10:18.318Z","0.0.1":"2014-11-06T17:54:37.075Z","0.0.2":"2014-11-06T18:09:47.715Z","0.0.3":"2014-11-06T18:11:48.734Z","0.0.4":"2014-11-06T18:14:59.653Z","0.0.5":"2014-11-06T18:21:37.830Z","0.0.6":"2014-11-06T18:26:15.583Z","0.0.7":"2014-11-06T18:40:46.238Z","0.0.8":"2014-11-06T18:49:15.681Z","0.0.9":"2014-11-06T18:59:26.917Z","0.1.0":"2014-11-06T20:04:38.940Z","0.1.1":"2014-11-06T20:07:35.196Z","0.1.2":"2014-11-06T20:11:58.573Z","0.1.3":"2014-11-06T21:08:53.186Z","0.1.4":"2014-11-07T10:50:33.674Z","0.1.6":"2014-12-06T13:41:37.407Z","0.2.0":"2015-01-14T12:52:30.402Z","0.3.1":"2015-02-02T12:08:24.420Z","0.4.0":"2015-02-03T09:54:14.124Z","0.4.1":"2015-02-03T11:21:22.753Z","0.4.2":"2015-02-03T21:24:32.553Z","0.4.3":"2015-02-04T17:07:57.462Z","0.4.4":"2015-02-04T17:14:40.586Z","0.4.5":"2015-02-04T17:19:05.478Z","0.4.6":"2015-02-04T17:20:32.262Z","0.4.7":"2015-02-04T17:30:42.038Z","0.4.8":"2015-02-04T17:35:10.028Z","0.4.9":"2015-02-04T17:38:37.307Z","0.4.10":"2015-02-04T17:46:27.577Z","0.5.0":"2015-02-04T17:54:28.396Z","0.5.1":"2015-02-04T17:56:12.216Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/skibz/tflobby","keywords":["hubot","hubot-irc","pickup","esports","e-sports","rcon","source
