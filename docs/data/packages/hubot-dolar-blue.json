This is the bot's name.\nCommands can be executed without the need to prepend the name of the bot when sending direct messages to it (db, dbn, etc.).\n\n### Install\nGoto your hubot root directory and run:\n\n`npm install hubot-dolar-blue --save`\n\nUpdate your `external-scripts.json` file adding _hubot-dolar-blue_ to the array.\n\nAlso, you'll need to have _imagemagick_ installed on your system.\n\n`apt-get install imagemagick`\n\nTo run `dbn` you'll need to edit `src/index.js` and change the following vars:\n- `imagesPath`: path with write permissions where images will be downloaded.\n- `croppedImageUrl`: URL where you serve your cropped image (it's a crop from the original rates image provided by dolarblue.net).\n\n**Note:** Only two images are saved and rewritten each time, so no worries about disk space.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"b3rt","email":"b3rt.js@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-03-25T18:57:13.863Z","created":"2014-12-31T23:04:36.372Z","1.0.0":"2014-12-31T23:04:36.372Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-25T18:53:13.286Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-25T18:57:13.863Z"},"keywords":["dolarblue","dolar","blue","argentina"],"author":{"name":"Alberto Miranda","email":"b3rt.js@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/codealchemist/hubot-dolar-blue","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/codealchemist/hubot-dolar-blue.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/codealchemist/hubot-dolar-blue/issues"},"_attachments":{}}
