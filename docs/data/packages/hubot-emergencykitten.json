Hubot: hubot-emergencykitten\r\n\r\nSometimes you need an emergency kitten.\r\nAll images come from http://www.emergencykitten.com/ ([GitHub](https://github.com/rgrove/emergencykitten/))and are either under a Creative Commons license or were marked as shareable by their creators.\r\n\r\nSee [`src/emergencykitten.coffee`](src/emergencykitten.coffee) for full documentation.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nRun `npm install hubot-emergencykitten --save`\r\n\r\nAdd **hubot-emergencykitten** to your `external-scripts.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\"hubot-emergencykitten\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sample Interaction\r\n\r\nThis script works best with Chat apps that support image preview (Slack, RocketChat, Mattermost, ...)\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser1> hubot kitten\r\nHubot> https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7078/7352069826_1e667da00b_b.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Update the kitten list\r\nThe list of kittens is located in [`data/kittens.coffee`](https://github.com/BackIsBachus/hubot-emergencykitten/blob/master/data/kittens.coffee) for easier access.\r\nIf other kittens are added to EmergencyKitten and you want them you can update the kitten list by running [getKittens.js](https://github.com/BackIsBachus/hubot-emergencykitten/blob/master/getKittens.js) in the console with NodeJS (the file should be located in the `node_modules/hubot-emergencykitten/` folder of your hubot installation folder):\r\n```\r\nnodejs getKittens.js\r\n```\r\nThe script is far from being what you could call \"proper JavaScript\", but it works and is far from enough considering you won't be running it that often.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"backisbachus","email":"backisbachus@backisbachus.xyz"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-13T16:41:26.237Z","created":"2016-10-12T16:34:35.925Z","0.0.1":"2016-10-12T16:34:35.925Z","0.1.0":"2016-10-12T18:10:19.558Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-12T23:22:00.194Z","1.1.0":"2016-10-12T23:37:13.633Z","1.2.0":"2016-10-13T16:14:51.228Z","1.2.1":"2016-10-13T16:41:26.237Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/BackIsBachus/hubot-emergencykitten#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","kitten","cat"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/BackIsBachus/hubot-emergencykitten.git"},"author":{"name":"BackIsBachus","email":"backisbachus@backisbachus.xyz"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/BackIsBachus/hubot-emergencykitten/issues"},"license":"LGPL-3.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
