Whenever the bot hears something which\nlooks like a JIRA issue (e.g. PROJECT-84123) it would check in JIRA and expand it in. Example:\n\n> john: Have seen PROJECT-84123?\n> hubot: [PROJECT-84123] The main database server is down, migrate to replicas\n> Status: To Do, assigned to John Harvee, rep. by Support team, fixVersion: NONE, priority: Major\n> https://jira-domain.com/browse/PROJECT-84123\n\nSee [`src/jirabot.coffee`](src/jirabot.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n## Fork\n\nThis is a fork of the [hubot-jirabot](https://github.com/agiledigital/hubot-jirabot). But this fork has some improvements over the upstream. Mainly,\nit would extract and show you all the JIRA tickets which are found in a message. Not just one of them.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-jirabot-ng --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-jirabot-ng** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-jirabot-ng\"]\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis plugin requires some environment variables in order to work. They are\n\n```\nHUBOT_JIRA_URL (format: \"https://jira-domain.com:9090\")\nHUBOT_JIRA_IGNORECASE (optional; default is \"true\")\nHUBOT_JIRA_USERNAME (optional)\nHUBOT_JIRA_PASSWORD (optional)\nHUBOT_JIRA_ISSUES_IGNORE_USERS (optional, format: \"user1|user2\", default is \"jira|github\")\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"iron4o","email":"ironsmile+npm@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-07-11T08:29:46.817Z","created":"2017-07-11T08:29:46.817Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-11T08:29:46.817Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ironsmile/hubot-jirabot-ng#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/ironsmile/hubot-jirabot-ng.git"},"author":{"name":"Doychin Atanasov","email":"ironsmile@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ironsmile/hubot-jirabot-ng/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
