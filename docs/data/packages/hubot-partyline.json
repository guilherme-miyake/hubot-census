In this way, Hubot Partyline can\nbecome a bridge between otherwise incompatible platforms (IRC, Slack, etc).\n\n> NB! This is currently in very early development stages and is currently nothing\n> more than a prototype. Proceed with caution.\n\n## Features\n\n### Terminology\n\n* *Peer* - another Hubot node on the network\n* *Seed* - a direct peer connection\n* *User* - a user anywhere in the network\n* *Mute* - stop displaying messages from a user locally\n* *Shun* - stop broadcasting messages to a peer\n* *Ignore* - do not interact with this user/peer\n\n### Available\n\n* Decentralized P2P network\n* Connect seeds via Hubot command\n\n### Planned\n\n* Persist peer data in Hubot brain\n* Disconnect seeds via Hubot command\n* Authorization support\n* Mute users (even across networks)\n* Shun peers\n* Ignore users\n* Peer rating system\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install hubot-partyline`\n\nThen add `\"hubot-partyline\"` to your Hubot's `external-scripts.json`\n\n## Configuration\n\n`HUBOT_PARTYLINE_PORT` - Default: 8879\n\n## Commands\n\n`hubot partyline add seed <host>:<port>` - add a peer and connect to it.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"therealklanni","email":"therealklanni@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-02-09T23:05:40.922Z","created":"2015-02-09T23:05:40.922Z","0.0.0":"2015-02-09T23:05:40.922Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-partyline","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","hubot-partyline","partyline"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-partyline.git"},"author":{"name":"Kevin Lanni","email":"therealklanni@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/therealklanni"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-partyline/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
