Then\r\nall you have to do is to update your `external-scripts.json` file to include our library. If this file is missing, simply\r\ncreate it with content:\r\n```json\r\n[\"hubot-polish-weather\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Set up the module\r\nThis module requires you to set up keys for the APIs.\r\n1) For the OpenWeather API, please set up the `HUBOT_WEATHER_OW_API_KEY` environment variable\r\n1) For the GeoNames API, please set up the `HUBOT_WEATHER_GN_USER` environment variable\r\n\r\n### Gathered information\r\nThe bot will show information about all weathers forecast for the day on this specific hour.\r\nAdditionally, it will also display general data like temperature, humidity and pressure.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nPogoda dla miasta Poznań jutro o 13:00:\r\nMoja urocza pogodynka opisała pogodę w taki sposób: :partly_sunny:rozproszone chmury.\r\nGarść statystyk: :thermometer:1.54 stopni Celsjusza, :cityscape:94 wilgotności, natomiast :stopwatch:ciśnienie wynosi 1002.82 hPa\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples of usage\r\nI tried to make this library as flexible for the user as possible. \r\n\r\nIf the user will pass only the name for the city, the library will assume, that he wants to see current weather forecast:\r\n```text\r\nhubot pogoda dla Gdańska\r\nhubot pogoda w Krakowie\r\n```\r\nThe bot will ignore diacritics and will display the weather forecast for the city with the biggest population in case\r\nof more matching cities.\r\n\r\nAfter first usage, the bot will remember last checked city for every user. It means that in this case he can just write:\r\n```text\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie\r\nhubot pogoda\r\n```\r\n... and the bot will remember in the second case, that it should check the Warsaw city.\r\n\r\nYou can also tell the bot to check the weather forecast for maximum 5 days (since in the free version, the API only allows\r\nso much days to be forecast). Because of this, I've decided to use *the weekday names* instead of dates (Monday, Tuesday,\r\ntomorrow, today etc.):\r\n```text\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie na jutro // weather forecast for tomorrow\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie w niedzielę // weather forecast for the Sunday\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie we wtorek // weather forecast for the Tuesday\r\n```\r\nOf course, you can also pass the exact hour to be checked. Since the weather forecasts are done in the 3-hours intervals,\r\nthe bot will find the closest interval to the passed date:\r\n```text\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie o 14:30 // will show weather forecast for today, 15:00\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie w poniedziałek o 18:00 // will show weather forecast for Monday, 18:00\r\nhubot pogoda w Warszawie na jutro o 12:10 // will show weather forecast for tomorrow, 12:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What about other languages?\r\nI tried to write this library in such a manner that will allow to easily port it to different language. \r\nI know that the polish version will not be popular, but there are many other libraries for \r\n[the english version](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=hubot%20weather). Polish version of the library exists only because\r\nof the requirement to use full cities and weekday names in the nominative case, which is fairly uncomfortable.\r\nIf you want help with implementing the fuzzy-logic weather forecast to your own language, feel free to ask me.\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\nIf you want to contribute, just fork the project and add some changes!\r\n\r\n## Errors and ideas to improve\r\nIf you will find any errors with this library or have great idea how to improve it (and don't want to do it on your own),\r\nplease feel free to open [a new ticket](https://gitlab.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-polish-weather/issues). \r\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
