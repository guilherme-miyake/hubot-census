Chat Support with Hubot\n\nThis module relays conversations between the web and wherever your Hubot lives.\n\n#### Quick Start\n\n* `cd [your/hubot/repo]`\n* `npm --save install hubot-support`\n* Add 'hubot-support' to your `external-scripts.json`\n    * This confused me once, so, FYI it's a JSON file with a single array of strings, each of which\n    is a module name (i.e. `hubot-support`) NOT a script path (i.e. `hubot-support.coffee`)\n* Start Hubot\n    `PORT=5000 bin/hubot -n bot`\n* Visit `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever PORT you picked)\n    * Enter your name\n    * Press return\n    * Send some messages to yourself\n* Respond to your messages in the Hubot shell with `bot support [name-of-client] go read the manual`\n* See all connected clients with `bot support`\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n* `HUBOT_SUPPORT_FRONTEND_DIR` - location of support frontend\n* `HUBOT_SUPPORT_EMAIL` - your support team's email, in case you are not home\n\n#### Customize the UI\n\nYou'll probably want to style up your frontend (like we did at https://chat-support.hired.com)\nso you can set the `HUBOT_SUPPORT_FRONTEND_DIR` environment variable to a directory\nrelative to Hubot's root where the frontend lives.  Hubot will serve this directory,\nstatically, at `/`.  (I'll make that route configurable soon).\n\nFor an example, take a look at the `fe` directory in this repo.  It's a simple\nfrontend bundle (meant for assembly with my tool - http://github.com/dashkb/fec)\nthat present a client app.  Experiment with how far you can modify it; behind the scenes\nBackbone is managing the views so I wouldn't change any element classes or ids that look\nsemantic.  The Fortitude classes (xs-pt1 and friends) are safe to change\n\n#### Hacking\n\nPrereq: you should be familiar with hacking on Node.js projects, and some\nHubot scripting experience might help.\n\n* Install my `fec` globally with `npm -g i fec`\n* Use `npm link` in this project ([docs](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html))\n* `npm link hubot-support` to itself; necessary only if you use the default UI\n* Clone a fresh hubot for testing from github.com/github/hubot\n* `npm link hubot-support` in the Hubot clone\n\nOk now this next part kinda sucks and I'm going to automate it at some point.  Background:\nthere are two things this project builds: the *client* and the *frontend*.  The\nfrontend depends on the client.\n\nThe *frontend* is built by running `fec [--compress]`.  Without rebuilding\nthe frontend, only backend changes (i.e. to `index.coffee` or files in the `server`\ndir) will affect your Hubot.  (You'll still have to restart Hubot for backend\nchanges to take effect.)\n\nThe *client* is built by running `bin/export-[debug-]client` in this project.  You\nMUST rebuild the frontend after exporting the client; else you'll be frustrated\nwhen your changes don't show up.  (See `fe/fe.coffee` for why; it's also the\nreason we `npm link` the project to itself.)\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"dashkb","email":"kyle@kylebrett.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-07-11T05:26:35.226Z","created":"2014-06-01T21:28:20.033Z","0.0.0":"2014-06-01T21:28:20.033Z","0.0.1":"2014-06-01T21:56:28.241Z","0.0.2":"2014-06-29T04:08:06.300Z","0.0.3":"2014-06-29T16:20:08.491Z","0.0.4":"2014-06-29T16:43:24.935Z","0.0.5":"2014-07-02T21:13:23.823Z","0.0.6":"2014-07-11T05:05:10.480Z","0.0.7":"2014-07-11T05:26:35.226Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hired/hubot-support","keywords":["hubot","chat","support"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/hired/hubot-support.git"},"author":{"name":"dashkb"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hired/hubot-support/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
