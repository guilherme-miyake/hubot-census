hubot-scripts\n\nThese are a collection of community scripts for [hubot][hubot], a chat bot for\nyour company.\n\n\n## Discovering\n\nCheck out the [hubot-script-catalog][script-catalog] for a list and description\nof all the available scripts.\n\n## Installing\n\nOnce you have Hubot installed, you should already have `hubot-scripts`\ninstalled. Check `package.json` to be sure. If that is the case, you update\n`hubot-scripts.json` to list any scripts from this repository you want to load.\nThe default `hubot-scripts.json` looks like:\n\n    [\"redis-brain.coffee\", \"tweet.coffee\", \"shipit.coffee\"]\n    \nIf you update `hubot-scripts` in `package.json`, you will automatically get\nupdates to your scripts listed here.\n    \nAlternatively, you can copy files from this repository into your `scripts`\ndirectory. Note that you would not get updates from the `hubot-scripts`\nrepository unless you copy them yourself.\n\nAny third-party dependencies for scripts need the addition of your\n`package.json` otherwise a lot of errors will be thrown during the start up of\nyour hubot. You can find a list of dependencies for a script in the\ndocumentation header at the top of the script.\n\nRestart your robot, and you're good to go.\n\nAll the scripts in this repository are located in [`src/scripts`][src-scripts].\n\n## Writing\n\nWant to write your own Hubot script? The best way is to take a look at an\n[existing script][example-script] and see how things are set up. Hubot scripts\nare written in CoffeeScript, a higher-level implementation of JavaScript.\n\nAdditionally, it's extremely helpful to add [TomDoc][tomdoc] to the top of each\nfile. (Check out [an example][example-script-doc]). We'll pull out the commands\nfrom those lines and display them in the generic, robot-wide `hubot help`\ncommand.\n\nPlease note we're no longer including external dependencies in the\n`package.json`, so should you wish to include them please include the package\nname and required version in the TomDoc comments at the top of your script.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe're now requiring all scripts in hubot-scripts to contain a documentation\nheader so people know every thing about the script.\n\n```coffeescript\n# Description\n#   <description of the scripts functionality>\n#\n# Dependencies:\n#   \"<module name>\": \"<module version>\"\n#\n# Configuration:\n#   LIST_OF_ENV_VARS_TO_SET\n#\n# Commands:\n#   hubot <trigger> - <what the respond trigger does>\n#   <trigger> - <what the hear trigger does>\n#\n# Notes:\n#   <optional notes required for the script>\n#\n# Author:\n#   <github username of the original script author>\n```\n\nIf you have nothing to fill in for a section you should include `None` in that\nsection. Empty sections which are optional should be left blank. A script will\nbe required to fill out the documentation before being merged into the\nrepository.\n\n[hubot]: https://github.com/github/hubot\n[script-catalog]: http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com\n[src-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts\n[tomdoc]: http://tomdoc.org\n[example-script]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/tweet.coffee \n[hubot-script-tests]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/test/tests.coffee\n[example-script-doc]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/speak.coffee#L1-5\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nick.heiner","email":"nth23@cornell.edu"},{"name":"alexandre.normand","email":"alexandre.normand@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-10-23T23:40:53.552Z","created":"2014-06-25T20:27:08.739Z","1.0.0":"2014-06-25T20:27:08.739Z","1.0.1":"2014-06-26T17:15:40.465Z","1.0.2":"2014-06-26T19:14:09.092Z","1.0.3":"2014-06-27T04:18:15.746Z","1.0.4":"2014-08-01T20:58:30.987Z","1.0.5":"2014-08-18T21:45:11.254Z","1.0.6":"2014-08-28T00:55:58.886Z","1.0.7":"2014-08-28T21:57:00.861Z","1.0.8":"2014-09-10T18:51:48.790Z","1.0.9":"2014-09-12T23:05:37.529Z","1.0.10":"2014-10-17T18:51:38.836Z","1.0.12":"2014-10-17T20:48:34.790Z","1.0.13":"2014-10-17T20:52:02.025Z","1.0.14":"2014-10-17T21:51:14.124Z","1.0.15":"2014-10-23T16:36:36.566Z","1.0.16":"2014-10-23T16:44:41.022Z","1.0.17":"2014-10-23T23:40:53.552Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nickheiner/nbot-scripts","keywords":["hubot","plugin","scripts","campfire","bot","nbot","robot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/nickheiner/nbot-scripts.git"},"author":{"name":"hubot"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nickheiner/nbot-scripts/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
