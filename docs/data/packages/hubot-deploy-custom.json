Script for providing deploy ability with custom scripts\n\nAdds a new command to hubot:\nCurrently only supporting deploying to one target (prod)\n```(name of hubot) deploy <target> <ref to deploy>```\n```(name of hubot) deploy <target>``` makes the default action defined in deploy.conf\n```(name of hubot) deploy``` defaults to ```(name of hubot) deploy stage```\n\n\nUpgrading\n======\n\nSave your deploy.conf somewhere outside the node_modules folder\n\nConfig\n======\n\nrenaming deploy.conf.example -> deploy.conf \n\nAdded a new filed to the config where you can put the repo name from gitlab so it knows which config to use to deploy on commit\n```deployhook web-repo-name``` web-repo-name should be the name of the repositoriy add hubot.url.com/deploy as a push hook on your repo\n\nHUBOT_DEPLOY_CUSTOM_CHANNEL put this into your environment so hubot knows where to post things to\n\n\nWorkflow for working with this addon\n====================================\n\n1. commit all things\n2. (test it)\n3. Increase Version and commit a new tag\n4. push to server ```git push origin```\n5. chat with hubot ```hubot deploy <target>```\n\n\nUpgrading\n====================================\n\nSave your deploy.conf to another location than node_modules\n\n##From before 0.0.9 to 0.0.9 or after:\nAdd ```HUBOT_DEPLOY_CUSTOM_CHANNEL``` to your environment\n\n\n\nWork based on following people\n==============================\n\n\nUses nice deploy script from visionmedia\nhttps://github.com/visionmedia/deploy\n\nMatt Pegler for the inspiration\nhttp://www.pegler.co/2012/03/django-deployment.html\n\n\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nUsing the common directory structure for hubot script packages it will be easy\nto manage and allow others to easily contribute to your package.\n\n### script\n\nThis directory is home to a couple of development scripts; `bootstrap` and `test`\nthey're used to bootstrap the development environment and run tests\nrespectively.\n\n### src\n\nThis directory is home to the actual hubot scripts in the package. Your\n`index.coffee` entry point will load the scripts from this directory.\n\n### test\n\nThis directory is home to any tests you write for your scripts. This example\npackage uses Mocha, Chai and Sinon to manage writing tests.\n\n## Advantages of Building a Package\n\nSome of the advantages of building an npm package for your hubot script(s) are:\n\n* You don't need to rely on when hubot-scripts package is released.\n* You can specify dependencies in the `package.json` rather than have users\n  manually specify them\n* You can easily add tests using your favourite frameworks and libraries\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"spruce","email":"spruce@space-ships.de"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-11-02T16:10:00.914Z","created":"2014-10-01T14:01:55.091Z","0.0.1":"2014-10-01T14:01:55.091Z","0.0.2":"2014-10-01T14:11:33.349Z","0.0.3":"2014-10-01T14:15:00.771Z","0.0.4":"2014-10-01T15:20:21.230Z","0.0.5":"2014-10-01T21:57:17.567Z","0.0.6":"2014-10-02T12:17:20.355Z","0.0.7":"2014-10-09T22:10:29.013Z","0.0.8":"2014-10-12T14:08:33.757Z","0.0.9":"2014-11-02T15:22:01.904Z","0.1.0":"2014-11-02T16:10:00.914Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/spruce/hubot-deploy-custom","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/spruce/hubot-deploy-custom.git"},"author":{"name":"Felix Fichte","email":"dev@spruce.de"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/spruce/hubot-deploy-custom/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
