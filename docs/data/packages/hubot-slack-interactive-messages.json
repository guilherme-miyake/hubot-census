Optionally can configure these via `SLACK_ACTIONS_URL`\nand  `SLACK_OPTIONS_URL`. This module does not add any hubot commands and is meant to be used by other scripts that use\nslack interactive messages.\n\n## Installation\n\n### For Hubot Projects\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-interactive-messages --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-interactive-messages** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-interactive-messages\"\n]\n```\n\n### For Hubot scripts\n\nAdd this module as a peer dependency and in your README mention that this needs to be added to the main project.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need to set `SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` env variable and also set the `/slack/actions` and `/slack/options`\n in the slack settings. You can find more info about that in\n [here](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages#configuration)\n\n## How to use\n\nGiven this module is properly install you can use `robot.setActionHandler` and `robot.setOptionsHandler` functions.\nThese are the `slackMessages.action` and `slackMessages.options`\nfrom [@slack/interactive-messages](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages).\n\n## Purpose and Future\n\nI created this module because I wanted to use Slack interactive messages in my\nhubot script, but if a project uses 2 or more scripts that both use\nSlack interactive messages, then there will be a problem of how do they\nboth use set up a single HTTP handler without interfering with each other.\n\nThis module basically tries to solve that problem using the official [@slack/interactive-messages](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages)\nmodule.\n\nI would like this module to be more than a dumb wrapper that it is\nright now. Ideally this module should help hubot scripts send cross-platform\ninteractive messages. This module should support other platforms that\nhave interactive messages or buttons and have text based(with urls)\nfallbacks for other platforms.\n\nI don't see any hubot scripts that uses interactive messages, and I'm\nhoping there will be more at least by using this module.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Olindata BV\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
