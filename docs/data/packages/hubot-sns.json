Subscribe Hubot to SNS\n\n   hubot-sns adds an endpoint at `/hubot/sns` that receives both subscription requests and notifications . By default, hubot-sns will confirm any subscription requests sent from SNS so you can simply subscribe your hubot in the console and it will automatically start receiving notifications.\n\n2. Handle incoming notifications\n\n   hubot-sns sends an event when notifications are received. You can use `robot.on` to handle these events. Your event handler can choose to handle all notifications or add individual handlers for specific topics.\n\n   ```coffeescript\n# scripts/your_script.coffee\nmodule.exports = (robot) ->\n\n  # Handle all notifications\n  robot.on \"sns:notification\", (msg) ->\n    \"\"\"\n    Received notification:\n      TopicArn:   #{msg.topicArn}\n      Topic:      #{msg.topic}\n      Message Id: #{msg.messageId}\n      Subject:    #{msg.subject}\n      Message:    #{msg.message}\n    \"\"\"\n\n  # Handle a specific topic (named mytopic in this example):\n  robot.on \"sns:notification:mytopic\", (msg) ->\n    \"\"\"\n    Received notification:\n      TopicArn:   #{msg.topicArn}\n      Topic:      #{msg.topic}\n      Message Id: #{msg.messageId}\n      Subject:    #{msg.subject}\n      Message:    #{msg.message}\n    \"\"\"\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mdouglass","email":"msed.npm@douglasstribe.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-11-24T18:40:26.091Z","created":"2014-11-18T03:33:58.896Z","0.1.0":"2014-11-18T03:33:58.896Z","0.2.0":"2014-11-19T19:58:43.717Z","0.2.1":"2014-11-24T18:40:26.091Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mdouglass/hubot-sns","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","aws","sns"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mdouglass/hubot-sns.git"},"author":{"name":"Matthew Douglass","email":"matthew+npm@douglasstribe.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mdouglass/hubot-sns/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"mdouglass":true},"_attachments":{}}
