Using\nthat approach in production is not recommended, as paper keys should be\nkept a secret.\n\n| Env variable     | Description |\n|------------------|-------------|\n| `KB_USERNAME`*   | If passed, a new Keybase service will be spawned using the passed username. |\n| `KB_PAPERKEY`*   | If passed, a new Keybase service will be spawned using the passed paper key. |\n| `KB_UNFURL_MODE` | If set, [unfurling mode](#unfurling) will be changed to the passed value. |\n\n\\* If you don't set either `KB_USERNAME` or `KB_PAPERKEY` the adapter will\ntry to attach to an already running Keybase service. This might be\ndesirable if you require support for features such as exploding messages.\n\n## Unfurling\n\nIn Keybase, unfurling means generating previews for links that you're\nsending in chat messages. If the mode is set to `always` or the domain in\nthe URL is present on the whitelist (which is not configurable using\n`hubot-keybase`), the Keybase service will automatically send a preview\nto the message recipient in a background chat channel.\n\nThis is incredibly useful for all sorts of Hubot plugins, as nearly every\nsingle script expects the chat software to automatically unfurl links.\nThat being said, this feature also has quite a few caveats, most\nimportantly it might leak the IP address of the server running Hubot.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ngs","email":"a@ngs.io"}],"time":{"modified":"2019-06-14T13:51:36.256Z","created":"2016-05-13T21:25:55.036Z","0.1.0":"2016-05-13T21:25:55.036Z","1.0.0":"2019-06-14T13:51:32.488Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/keybase/hubot-keybase#readme","keywords":["hubot","adapter","keybase","bot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/keybase/hubot-keybase.git"},"author":{"name":"Keybase","url":"https://keybase.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/keybase/hubot-keybase/issues","email":"piotr@keyba.se"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","contributors":[{"name":"Piotr Zduniak","email":"piotr@keyba.se"}]}
