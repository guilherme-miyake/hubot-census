Just put them in `scripts`,\nrestart your robot, and you're good to go.\n\nAll the scripts in this repository are located in\n[`src/scripts`](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts).\n\n## Writing\n\nWant to write your own Hubot script? The best way is to take a look at an\n[existing script](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/tweet.coffee)\nand see how things are set up. Hubot scripts are written in CoffeeScript, a\nhigher-level implementation of JavaScript.\n\nYou'll also want to [add tests](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/test/tests.coffee)\nfor your script; no one likes untested code. It makes Hubot sad.\n\nAdditionally, it's extremely helpful to add [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org) to the\ntop of each file. (Check out [an example](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/speak.coffee#L1-5)).\nWe'll pull out the commands from those lines and display them in the generic,\nrobot-wide `hubot help` command.\n\n## Scripts\n\n## spin.coffee\n\n### Spin me\n\n__Format:__\n\n    (@yourbot )spin me <query> - Returns a spun version of the input.\n\n__Input:__\n\n    spin me {Hi there|Greetings|Hi|Hello|Hello There}{!|,}\n\n    I {really|simply|totally} {love|respect|admire} your {blog|article|post|opinion} and {will tell all my friends about it|will be back again tomorrow|also the design of your website}.\n\n    {Thanks|Thank you|Cheers|Bye for now}!\n\n__Output:__\n\n    Greetings!\n\n    I simply admire your blog and also the design of your website.\n\n    Cheers!\n\n### Spun me\n\n__Format:__\n\n    (@yourbot )spun me <query> - Returns a spintax version of the input using articlemanager.us spinner API.\n\n__Input:__\n\n    spun me Below it sat a wooden case of trophies and other awards.
