Noysi\nIn order to use your own **HUBOT** you first need to get a new token, so the robot can connect to NOYSI's infrastructure.    \n  1. Log in Noysi with your account.  \n  2. Click on the down-arrow displayed next to your profile name, on the left-upper corner.  \n  3. Click in *integrations*.  \n  4. Look for **HUBOT** under the *all services* tab and press *see*.  \n  5. Set a name to your new robot and press *Add Hubot*.   \n  6. The new token for your newly created HUBOT is available in the first text-box, named *API Token*.  \n  7. Click in the button *Save integration*. Your new HUBOT is now created and available.\n  \n### Installing HUBOT  \nHUBOT needs yeoman to generate the HUBOT code. These steps will install HUBOT, yeoman, the generator-hubot, the coffee-script package and hubot-conversation.  \n  1. ```npm install -g hubot coffee-script yo generator-hubot```\n  2. ```mkdir /path/to/hubot```\n  3. ```cd /path/to/hubot```\n  4. ```yo hubot```\n  5. ```npm install hubot-noysi --save```\n \n### Configuring HUBOT to use Noysi Token  \nNow it is needed to include the token generated in *Getting a TOKEN from Noysi* section to your new HUBOT instance. It can be achieved in at least two ways:  \n  1. Edit your ```~/.bashrc```file to include a new environment variable like: ```export NOYSI_TOKEN=<your_token_here>```. Don't forget to logout or do a ```source ~/.bashrc``` so your new variable it is available to HUBOT.  \n  2. Run your HUBOT with the token passed as an argument: ```NOYSI_TOKEN=<your_token_here>./bin/hubot -a noysi```\n","maintainers":[{"email":"humbertof44@gmail.com","name":"humbertof44"},{"email":"noysi@noysi.com","name":"noysi-npm"}],"time":{"modified":"2020-05-07T08:24:18.602Z","created":"2015-12-10T17:05:21.657Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-10T17:05:21.657Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-15T21:28:08.883Z","1.0.2":"2016-01-05T09:56:14.015Z","1.0.3":"2016-01-05T10:00:52.905Z","1.0.4":"2016-01-05T18:51:35.185Z","1.0.5":"2016-02-24T18:42:49.192Z"},"author":{"name":"Luis Gervaso"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
