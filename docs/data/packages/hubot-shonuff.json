Your\n`index.coffee` entry point will load the scripts from this directory.\n\n### test\n\nThis directory is home to any tests you write for your scripts. This example\npackage uses Mocha, Chai and Sinon to manage writing tests.\n\n## Advantages of Building a Package\n\nSome of the advantages of building an npm package for your hubot script(s) are:\n\n* You don't need to rely on when hubot-scripts package is released.\n* You can specify dependencies in the `package.json` rather than have users\n  manually specify them\n* You can easily add tests using your favourite frameworks and libraries\n","maintainers":[{"name":"todd.gardner","email":"todd.gardner@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-06-04T18:32:43.121Z","created":"2015-06-04T17:49:38.247Z","1.0.0":"2015-06-04T17:49:38.247Z","1.0.1":"2015-06-04T18:21:02.364Z","1.0.2":"2015-06-04T18:32:43.121Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tmgardner/hubot-shonuff","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/tmgardner/hubot-shonuff.git"},"author":{"name":"Todd Gardner","email":"todd.gardner@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tmgardner/hubot-shonuff/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
