You'll first need a Hubot instance set up. Follow the instructions at https://hubot.github.com/docs/.  \nWhen it asks for the `Bot adapter`, specify `basecamp-3`.\n\n2. Open a Basecamp and click on `Settings` in the top right corner.\n\n3. Choose the `Configure Chatbots` option.\n\n4. Add a new chatbot and point the `Command URL` to your Hubot host, with a path of `/hubot/bc3`.  \ne.g. if your Hubot instance lives at `internal.domain`, set the URL toÂ `http://internal.domain/hubot/bc3`.\n\n5. Launch Hubot like so: `./bin/hubot --adapter basecamp-3`.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"williammck","email":"me@williammck.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-10-08T19:45:51.363Z","created":"2017-01-10T18:09:42.646Z","1.0.0":"2017-01-10T18:09:42.646Z","1.0.1":"2017-01-10T20:25:12.881Z","1.0.2":"2017-10-08T19:45:51.363Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/williammck/hubot-basecamp-3#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/williammck/hubot-basecamp-3.git"},"author":{"name":"William McKinnerney","email":"me@williammck.net","url":"https://williammck.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/williammck/hubot-basecamp-3/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
