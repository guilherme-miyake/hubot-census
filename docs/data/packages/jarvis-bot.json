your most powerful bot and loyal butler. Jarvis was originally built for **GLOBAL_HACKERS** as our smart, humorous and [sentient](#chat) team assistant.\n\nThe most popular and powerful features for us include *todo, reminder, memes, search, and a machine learning module.* See the [design](#design) and all the [features](#features).\n\n\n## Installation\nClone this git repo:\n\n```\ngit clone <the-url-of-this-repo>\n```\n\nAlso available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jarvis-bot):\n\n```\nnpm install jarvis-bot\n```\n\nNext, install the dependencies:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen [setup](#setup) and [deploy](#deploy).\n\n*Tl;dr*: If you're using Slack, just set `bin/.env` file, fill the `bin/.env-jarvis` with API tokens and run `npm start`.\n\n#### forever\n\n`npm start` runs `app.js`, which uses `forever-monitor`. This is for when you don't have `sudo` to install `forever` on the machine you're deploying on. This has the issue of nested processes not being terminated properly (a `forever` issue.)\n\nThings are nicer if you use [`forever`](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) from the terminal, you can deploy/stop multiple instances (after specifying the right file in `.env`) like below:\n\n```\nforever start --killSignal=SIGTERM -a -l jarvis.log --uid \"jarvis\" run.js\nforever start --killSignal=SIGTERM -a -l veronica.log --uid \"veronica\" run.js\n```\n\nNote that you must set `--killSignal=SIGTERM` to properly kill off hubot. You can kill like below:\n\n```\n# stop an instance\nforever stop jarvis\n# stop all instances\nforever stopall\n```\n\n##### forever in npm\nI'm a lazy person. So I save the `forever` commands above in the npm scripts. For example in `package.json`:\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\",\n    \"stop\": \"forever stopall\",\n    \"jarvis\": \"forever start --minUptime=1000 --spinSleepTime=1000 --killSignal=SIGTERM -a -l jarvis.log --uid 'jarvis' app.js\",\n    \"veronica\": ...\n},\n```\n\nSo instead of typing that long command for `forever`, you can\n\n```\n# runs that long forever command\nnpm run jarvis\n```\n\nTo stop all `forever` processes,\n\n```\nnpm stop\n```\n\n\n## <a name=\"setup\"></a>Setup\n\n\n#### .env\nJarvis uses many APIs, and some of them need tokens. Set the environment variables for each instance of your bot in `bin/.env-<bot>`. Most of them should be straightforward to obtain, others you can Google how to. Below is a few, explained:\n\n- `HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN`: You have to add a bot integration under your Slack team setting, and generate a token to use.\n- `HUBOT_REPOPATH`: This is the bot's repo that you're syncing the memory with.\n- `HUBOT_GHTOKEN`: To sync memory (upload to Github), you need to allow access and generate a token from your account.\n- `HUBOT_GOOGLE_API_KEY`: You need a Google developer account, then create a project, choose the APIs to enable, and generate a \"browser token\" from the Google Developer Console.\n\n**Beware**, don't expose your `.env-<bot>` files to other people. That's common sense.\n\n\n#### admins\nA few bot functions such as memory upload and twitter posts are restricted to admins. Specify their email addresses, comma separated, in `bin/.env-<bot>`. Note that the incoming user object from Slack has the email field, so if you're using a different adapter, you may need to hack around it from `scripts/helper.coffee`.\n\nThe reason for using email address is because username can be changed (in Slack) and thus be faked.\n\n\n#### <a name=\"adapter\"></a>adapter\nThe default adapter is Slack. To change it, find them [here](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md). NPM uninstall `hubot-slack`, install your adapter, and specify it in [`bin/.env`](./bin/.env).\n\nSince the text formatting are meant for Slack, you may need to hack the scripts a bit when you're using a different chat platform, especially with how the admin emails are recognized.\n\n\n## <a name=\"deploy\"></a>Deploy\nIf you're using Slack, then deployment is super simple. Simply set your API keys in `bin/.env-<bot>` and specify which bot to deploy in `bin/.env`, then you're ready. See [Setup](#setup).\n\nDeploy anywhere you want: *Heroku, GCloud, AWS, your local Unix machines*. There is no need to setup the bot environment variables yourself because `app.js` handles them for you. As long as `npm install` and `npm start` (which runs `node app.js`) are run, you're good.\n\nJarvis is quasi-immortal. He will never sleep (uses `cron`), and will resurrect upon death (uses `forever-monitor`).\n\nTest-run locally with \n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nEven though Jarvis is platform neutral, we deploy ours to Google Cloud, so the files `.dockerignore, Dockerfile, app.yaml` are needed. Remove and add any deployment config files as you need if you deploy somewhere else.\n\n\n## <a name=\"design\"></a>Design\nWe built Jarvis to be the smart assistant for our team. The design is based on `hubot`, and we have made significant improvements to its core but you probably won't notice. So, if you've had experience with `hubot`, you'll know how to extend Jarvis by writing your own scripts.\n\nJarvis' internal modules are different from the original hubot:\n\n- `hubot-keep-alive` is removed and replaced by the more elegant `cron`\n- external persistent memory in sync with the bot's Github\n- a more helpful help menu with categorization, under `scripts/cmdhelp.coffee`\n- several other internal modules are replaced by better ones\n\nAll the modules and hubot scripts are in `node_modules` and `scripts`, following the original hubot design. `lib` contains your non-hubot-interface scripts. In short, organize as you like, but the bot interface scripts shall be in the `scripts` folder.\n\n#### Platform-neutral\nJust like the original hubot, Jarvis is platform-neutral. We deploy our Jarvis on Slack, but you can choose your own platform by simply changing the `adapter` (see [Setup](#adapter)).\n\nThe powerful thing is that you can access Jarvis from anywhere! We use Slack, so we can call Jarvis from the Slack apps for mobile, laptop, and web.\n\n\n\n## <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\nWe lost count on the number of features. There's currently over 30 modular scripts (some under node_modules). Feel free to remove/add any from your bot as you like. If you got a brilliant idea, suggest to us!\n\n| List of features |\n|:----|\n| [Minimal setup, quick deployment](#minimal) |\n| [Platform and deployment neutral](#platform) |\n| [Quasi-immortality](#immortal) |\n| [Admins](#admin) |\n| [Memory - persistent and synced with Github](#memsync) |\n| [Custom command help](#cmd) |\n| [User aliasing, serialization, recognition](#alias) |\n| [User geolocation, time, weather, maps](#geo) |\n| [Reminder, todo](#todo) |\n| [Google search, image, translate, maps, directions, youtube](#google) |\n| [Hackers News](#hn) |\n| [Twitter search/post](#twitter) |\n| [Machine learning/sentiment analysis](#sa) |\n| [Lomath](#lomath) |\n| [Chatbot](#chat) |\n| [Memes and jokes](#meme) |\n<!-- | [View window](#view) | -->\n\n\n#### <a name=\"minimal\"></a>Minimal setup, quick deployment\nYou don't have to do much to start using Jarvis. Just get your API keys/tokens for the APIs you wish to use to put in [`.env-jarvis`](./bin/.env-jarvis) under [`bin/`](./bin). If you have several teams to deploy the bots for, you can have multiple `.env-<bot>` files. Before deploying, specify the bot you wish to deploy in `.env`.\n\nThis assumes you're using Slack of course. For more advanced tweaks, see [Setup](#setup).\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"platform\"></a>Platform and deployment neutral\nJarvis is designed to be deployed anywhere. All its internal environment variables are specified in `.env-<bot>` file, and it sets them automatically when run. This nicely prevents fragmentation of providing different env files per deployment, like `app.yaml` for Gcloud, and `app.json` for Heroku.\n\nWe use Slack, but you can just use pretty much anything else: Whatsapp, Telegram, FB chat, Skype. Just replace the hubot adapter by specifying it in `package.json` and `.env`.\n\nThe powerful thing is that you can access Jarvis from anywhere! We use Slack, so we can call Jarvis from the Slack apps for mobile, laptop, and web.\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"platform\"></a>Quasi-immortality\nMy team likes to break things, and Jarvis was the obvious target. \n\nJarvis is quasi-immortal. He will never sleep (uses `cron`), and will resurrect upon death (uses `forever-monitor`). So, kill him as many times as you wish, he will always come back to live, unless if the server farm gets nuked of course.\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"admin\"></a>Admins\nThere are things that should be accessible only to admins. One example is memory sync (below), where only admins can make Jarvis upload his memory. See `.env-<bot>` to set the admins for each bot.\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"memsync\"></a>Memory - persistent and synced with Github\nWe constantly improve Jarvis, thus the source code is kept on Github. However, when we redeploy Jarvis (due to death or new iteration), we want him to remember us.\n\nJarvis's `hubot.brain.data` persistent memory is kept under `memory/braindata.json`. You can get creative and make your own modular memory.\n\nWhen deployed, Jarvis can sync its new memory with its Github, so before redeploying, you can just do `git pull` to update the local memory. Then the new Jarvis will remember.\n\nIt's scheduled to auto-upload its brain to Github every midnight, but admin can also manually tell Jarvis to do so. The commands for this module is hidden to prevent tampering, so dig into the source code. See [scripts/memsync.coffee](./scripts/memsync.coffee), where you can set a magic word to call, and if you're an admin, Jarvis will upload his brain.\n\n<img src=\"./docs/brainupload.png\" alt=\"Admin call\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n<img src=\"./docs/jarvisupload.png\" alt=\"Jarvis upload\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"cmd\"></a>Custom command help\nYou can organize all your help commands into types. See `typedCmd` in [`scripts/helper.coffee`](./scripts/helper.coffee), where the JSON goes from type to module to the command regex of the module. Currently there are 3 types: `fun, bot, util`, and each has its own modules(named as you like). The array for each module contains its command regexs, which are used for preventing conflict in input-parsing.\n\nBelow is the `help` in action, going down the level of specificity. Furthermore, `help <term>` displays all the helps that match the `<term>`.\n\n<img src=\"./docs/cmdhelp.png\" alt=\"Command help\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"alias\"></a>User aliasing, serialization, recognition\nJarvis recognizes users by their usernames; you can also add aliases. \n\n<img src=\"./docs/aliasing.png\" alt=\"aliasing\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\nWith the recognition, Jarvis can serialize its functions such as weather and reminders to cater to individual users. You can call the functions using aliases too. Furthermore, Jarvis will recognize fuzzy usernames (lexicographically, so be careful).\n\n<img src=\"./docs/aliascall.png\" alt=\"aliascall\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"geo\"></a>User geolocation, time, weather, maps\nOur team is global, so it's handy to know where someone is and the time there. User serialization is used here, so simply tell Jarvis where you are, and when you call the functions, Jarvis will use your location.\n\n<img src=\"./docs/timeweathermap.png\" alt=\"timeweathermap\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"todo\"></a>Reminder, todo\nJarvis can remind you of things at certain time, and keep a todo list for you. Of course you can have Jarvis remind your teammates of their tasks.\n\n*Reminder is time sensitive, and defaults to 1h if time is not specified:*\n<img src=\"./docs/remind.png\" alt=\"remind\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n*Todo list is not time sensitive:*\n<img src=\"./docs/todo.png\" alt=\"todo\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"google\"></a>Google search, image, translate, maps, directions, youtube\nJarvis uses many Google APIs (you'll need your own Google developer API keys) to use them.\n<img src=\"./docs/google.png\" alt=\"google\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n*Jarvis recognizes `me` or user aliases when using locations.*\n<img src=\"./docs/directions.png\" alt=\"directions\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n#### <a name=\"hn\"></a>Hackers News\nNo hackers can do without Hackers News, so here it is:\n<img src=\"./docs/hn.png\" alt=\"hn\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n\n#### <a name=\"twitter\"></a>Twitter search/post\nJarvis can search on Twitter, and post (admin only).\n<img src=\"./docs/tweet.png\" alt=\"tweet\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n#### <a name=\"sa\"></a>Machine learning/sentiment analysis\nThis is the first stage of an AI Jarvis, and [`scripts/sentiment.coffee`](./scripts/sentiment.coffee) is its first machine learning module. This pulls search results from Twitter, feeds it to [Indico.io](https://indico.io), and returns the sentiment. This is especially handy for observing the trend of a topic on Twitter, say a stock.\n\nExpect more AI/ML features to come soon, since the author is studying that.\n\n<img src=\"./docs/sa.png\" alt=\"sa\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n#### <a name=\"lomath\"></a>Lomath\n[`Lomath`](http://kengz.github.io/lomath/) is a math library extended from `lodash`. You can evaluate a lomath function from Jarvis as you would code it, which also means you can use `lodash`.\n\n<img src=\"./docs/lomath.png\" alt=\"lomath\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display:inline-block\"/>\n\n\n#### <a name=\"chat\"></a>Chatbot\nTo make Jarvis more human-like, we added a chatbot module to it. Whenever you say something that doesn't match a command regex of `typedCmd` in [`scripts/helper.coffee`](./scripts/helper.coffee), it will be redirected to the chat module.\n\nThe chat module is serialized for each user, so Jarvis can keep the conversations separate.
