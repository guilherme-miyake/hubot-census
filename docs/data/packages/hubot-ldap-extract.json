developherr/hubot-ldap-extract\n\nA Hubot script that extracts information from an LDAP server.\n\nWhatever information you hold available within your LDAP - Hubot can give you an overview on that information\n\n## Installation\n\n```npm install hubot-ldap-extract --save```\n\nThen, add the script to the external-scripts.json file:\n\n```\n[\n  \"hubot-ldap-extract\"\n]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfigure this package by setting its corresponding environment variables:\n\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_LDAPURL``` - URL of the LDAP server, including protocol and port, e.g. ```ldap://yourldaphost:389```. Make sure the protocol matches the TLS mode provided below.\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_BIND_DN``` - bind DN used for LDAP connection\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_BIND_SECRET``` - bind password used for LDAP connection\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_SEARCH_BASE_DN``` - search base for contact information\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_SEARCH_FILTER``` - search filter to be used, use {{searchTerm}} as placeholder for the user's search query, e.g. ```(uid={{searchTerm}})```\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_RESULT_TPL``` - Handlebars template to be used to present matching information to the user (can use helpers from npm handlebards-helpers package + 'any' helper )\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_TLSMODE``` - plain|starttls|tls remember to provide the CA cert if you set this to starttls or tls. If you set this to tls, also make sure to use ldaps:// as the protocol in LDAP_URL\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_CA_CERT``` - CA cert when using tls|starttls\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_LISTENING_TRIGGER``` - the keyword to listen to in hubot conversations (can also be set to be a regular expression, e.g. ```(directory|info|ldap|contact)```, default: ```ldap```)\n- ```LDAP_EXTRACT_MAXRESULTS``` - max. no of result items returned (default: 5)\n\n### Response template\n\nThe template used to render entries matching a given search query is defined in ```LDAP_EXTRACT_RESULT_TPL``` and must contain a [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) template. In addition to the built-in helpers, helpers from the [handlebars-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) as well as the [any](https://www.npmjs.com/package/any) packages are also available. This allows conveniently applying different responses for each matching entry, based on its individual attributes.\n\n#### Using the _any_ helper\n\nThe _any_ helper is being used as a block expression:\n\n```\n{{#any [1,2,3] 3}}\n    {{../permalink}}\n{{/any}}\n```\n\n#### Example template\n\n```\n{{#contains objectClass \"employee\"}}\n  *{{displayName}}*\n    {{#if accountActive}}  \n      {{title}}\n      {{ou}} ({{l}})\n      {{mail}}\n      {{telephoneNumber}}\n      {{#if mobile}}{{mobile}}{{/if}}\n    {{else}}\n      _Inactive user - contact HR for contact information_\n    {{/if}}\n{{/contains}}    \n{{#contains objectClass \"external\"}}\n    {{#unless accountActive}}_Inactive user_{{/unless}}\n    {{employeeType}}\n    {{svTeam}}\n    {{mail}}\n    {{telephoneNumber}}\n    {{#if mobile}}{{mobile}}{{/if}}\n    {{#if street}}\n      {{street}}\n      {{postalCode}} {{l}}\n    {{/if}}\n{{/contains}}\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```hubot ldap <searchquery>```, where _ldap_ could be overridden in you particular case via ```LDAP_EXTRACT_LISTENING_TRIGGER```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"developherr","email":"developherr@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-04-10T16:56:12.777Z","created":"2017-04-10T15:00:22.591Z","0.3.8":"2017-04-10T15:00:22.591Z","0.3.10":"2017-04-10T15:57:03.906Z","0.3.11":"2017-04-10T16:05:27.075Z","0.3.13":"2017-04-10T16:08:48.552Z","0.3.14":"2017-04-10T16:54:22.522Z","0.3.15":"2017-04-10T16:56:12.777Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/developherr/hubot-ldap-extract","keywords":["hubot","ldap","contact","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/developherr/hubot-ldap-extract.git"},"author":{"name":"developherr","email":"developherr@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/developherr/hubot-ldap-extract/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
