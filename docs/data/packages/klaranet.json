in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/project-bitmark/klaranet.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/project-bitmark/klaranet)\n# Klaranet\n\nThis is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.\n\nThis version is designed to be deployed on [Heroku][heroku]. This README was generated for you by hubot to help get you started. Definitely update and improve to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he has, etc!\n\n[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com\n\n### Testing Hubot Locally\n\nYou can test your hubot by running the following.\n\n    % bin/hubot\n\nYou'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a\nprompt.\n\n    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell\n    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts\n    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts\n    Hubot>\n\nThen you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.\n\n    Hubot> hubot help\n\n    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few\n    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.\n    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.\n    ...\n\n\n### Scripting\n\nTake a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples.\nDelete any scripts you think are useless or boring.  Add whatever functionality you\nwant hubot to have. Read up on what you can do with hubot in the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).\n\n### Redis Persistence\n\nIf you are going to use the `redis-brain.coffee` script from `hubot-scripts`\n(strongly suggested), you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified\naccount or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually\nset the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.\n\n    % heroku config:set REDISTOGO_URL=\"...\"\n\nIf you don't require any persistence feel free to remove the\n`redis-brain.coffee` from `hubot-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry\nabout redis at all.\n\n[redistogo]: https://redistogo.com/\n\n## Adapters\n\nAdapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on. This\ncan be something like Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party\nadapters that the community have contributed. Check\n[Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the available ones.\n\nIf you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add\nthe adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the\n`dependencies` section.\n\nOnce you've added the dependency and run `npm install` to install it you can\nthen run hubot with the adapter.\n\n    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>\n\nWhere `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## hubot-scripts\n\nThere will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead\nof adding it to hubot itself, you can submit pull requests to\n[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts].\n\nTo enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with\nextension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this\nrepo.\n\n[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts\n\n## external-scripts\n\nTired of waiting for your script to be merged into `hubot-scripts`? Want to\nmaintain the repository and package yourself? Then this added functionality\nmaybe for you!\n\nHubot is now able to load scripts from third-party `npm` packages! To enable\nthis functionality you can follow the following steps.\n\n1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`\n2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed\n\nTo enable third-party scripts that you've added you will need to add the package\nname as a double quoted string to the `external-scripts.json` file in this repo.\n\n## Deployment\n\n    % heroku create --stack cedar\n    % git push heroku master\n    % heroku ps:scale app=1\n\nIf your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable\nand add the Redis to Go addon to your app.\n\n    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano\n\nIf you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].\n\nYou'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.\n\nMore detailed documentation can be found on the\n[deploying hubot onto Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.\n\n### Deploying to UNIX or Windows\n\nIf you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.\nPlease check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and\n[deploying hubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.\n\n[heroku-node-docs]: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js\n[deploy-heroku]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md\n[deploy-unix]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n[deploy-windows]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n\n## Campfire Variables\n\nIf you are using the Campfire adapter you will need to set some environment\nvariables. Refer to the documentation for other adapters and the configuraiton\nof those, links to the adapters can be found on [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters].\n\nCreate a separate Campfire user for your bot and get their token from the web\nUI.\n\n    % heroku config:set HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=\"...\"\n\nGet the numeric IDs of the rooms you want the bot to join, comma delimited. If\nyou want the bot to connect to `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/42`\nand `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/1024` then you'd add it like this:\n\n    % heroku config:set HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS=\"42,1024\"\n\nAdd the subdomain hubot should connect to. If you web URL looks like\n`http://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com` then you'd add it like this:\n\n    % heroku config:set HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=\"mysubdomain\"\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Restart the bot\n\nYou may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart`\nif you're having issues.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"melvincarvalho","email":"melvincarvalho@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-09-29T00:08:10.611Z","created":"2016-09-27T20:32:47.171Z","0.0.1":"2016-09-27T20:32:47.171Z","0.0.2":"2016-09-28T08:36:59.962Z","0.0.3":"2016-09-28T09:17:04.225Z","0.0.4":"2016-09-28T09:22:05.963Z","0.0.5":"2016-09-29T00:08:10.611Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/github/hubot#readme","keywords":["github","hubot","klaranet","bot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/github/hubot.git"},"author":{"name":"Melvin Carvalho","email":"melvincarvalho@gmail.com","url":"https://melvincarvalho.com/#me"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/github/hubot/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
