`HUBOT_GITTER2_TOKEN`: get your personal token [there](http://developer.gitter.im) after sign-in\n    - the bot will automatically listen on the rooms it has joined.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If your bot is not responding to mentions, make sure hubot was started with the same `--name` parameter as its GitHub username.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **0.1.3** - `2014-08-20`\n  - Added the ability to ignore all rooms except given one(s) for testing with `HUBOT_GITTER2_TESTING_ROOMS`\n  - Implemented a room ignore-list to not handle messages from some rooms with `HUBOT_GITTER2_IGNORE_ROOMS`\n\n- **0.1.2** - `2014-08-16`\n  - Re-wrote everything in a cleaner, object oriented way\n  - Better handling of users\n  - Auto-listening on the rooms the bot's user has already joined\n  - Do not overwrite brain user names, only update if not set\n\n- **0.0.3** - `2014-08-11`\n  - First functional pre-version\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nemaniarjun","email":"Nemaniarjun@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-01-03T10:30:29.948Z","created":"2017-01-03T10:18:42.032Z","0.0.1":"2017-01-03T10:18:42.032Z","0.0.2":"2017-01-03T10:30:29.948Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nemaniarjun/hubot-gitter2","keywords":["hubot","gitter","adapter"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/nemaniarjun/hubot-gitter2.git"},"author":{"name":"Arjun Nemani","email":"nemaniarjun@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nemaniarjun/hubot-gitter2/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
