Install through npm\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install --save hubot-geocoder\r\n```\r\n2. Setup a Google Maps API Key\r\n\r\nThe [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) allows you to setup an API key easily. Go ahead and follow the steps there.\r\n\r\n3. Setup a Hubot Chatbot\r\n\r\nIf you haven't done so already, head on over to the [Hubot Page](https://hubot.github.com) and set up a personal hubot for yourself.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nhubot-geocoder is intended to be used with a conversational dialog between the bot and the user. The current package being used for this is the [hubot-conversation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-conversation) package available on npm. It provides a convenient way for two-way conversation. Make sure you have this package installed and require it in your hubot script file. Below is a sample usage.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Conversation = require('hubot-conversation');\r\nvar hubotGeocode = require('hubot-geocode');\r\nvar needle = require('needle');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function(robot) {\r\n  var switchBoard = new Conversation(robot);\r\n  robot.hear(/get restaurants near me/, function(msg) {\r\n    var dialog = switchBoard.startDialog(msg);\r\n    msg.reply('Sure, What is your address or city, state? (e.g. New York, NY or 132 Main St, New York, NY)');\r\n\r\n    dialog.addChoice(/(^)/i, function (msg2) {\r\n      /*\r\n      * the geocode function returns an object that contains an array of latitudes and longitudes. In most cases,\r\n      * there will be only one entry in that array, but sometimes the inputted location may return more than one pair of coordinates.\r\n      * The inputs are msg2 (the message from the hubot-conversation dialog function), apiKey (your google maps api key),\r\n      * botName (your hubot's name. hubot is the default value if you don't have a custom bot set up.)\r\n      */\r\n\r\n      var apiKey = \"<your-google-maps-api-key>\";\r\n      hubotGeocode(msg2, apiKey, \"restaurantbot\", function (err, resp) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n          msg.reply(\"Oh no! Something went wrong while I was trying to get your coordinates. Check back in a bit, I'll get on it!\");\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n        var options = {\r\n          headers : {\r\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\r\n          },\r\n          location: resp[0].lat + \",\" + resp[0].lng,\r\n          radius: 500,\r\n          type: 'restaurant'\r\n        };\r\n        // get nearest restaurants by calling the google places api\r\n        needle.get(\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=\"+options.location+\"&radius=5000&type=restaurant&key=\"+apiKey,\r\n          function (err, resp) {\r\n            if (err) {\r\n              console.log(\"error!!\");\r\n              console.log(err);\r\n              msg2.reply(\"Oh no, an error occured :(\");\r\n            } else {\r\n              console.log(\"success!!\");\r\n              console.log(resp.body);\r\n              resp.body.results.forEach(function (restaurant) {\r\n                msg2.emote(restaurant.name + \", \" + restaurant.vicinity);\r\n              });\r\n              msg2.reply(\"Got back something! Check the console\");\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n* The hubot-conversation package is required in order for the geocoder to properly return the inputted coordinates. This is because we want our hubot to utilize the returned coordinates in further api calls, such as getting closest restaurants.\r\n* More than one pair of geocoded coordinates may be returned by the geocoder. If that is the case, you want to make sure the first object (resp[0]) contains the actual coordinates you want. To go around this, you could ask the user to select the correct location from the array of results.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md).","versions":{"1.0.1":{"name":"hubot-geocoder","version":"1.0.1","description":"A geocoder for hubot that utilizes the Google Maps API to return position coordinates based on a user inputted address.","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder.git"},"keywords":["hubot","geocode","slack","hubot-scripts"],"author":{"name":"Andrew Tehrani","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com","url":"http://andrewtehrani.com"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder#readme","dependencies":{"needle":"^1.6.0"},"gitHead":"7eda480cf6990e671306d87333c807729cbdc7dd","_id":"hubot-geocoder@1.0.1","_shasum":"f56b9c45ec11574d6833ddc57dfe5324942bf050","_from":".","_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_nodeVersion":"6.10.2","_npmUser":{"name":"atehrani21","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"f56b9c45ec11574d6833ddc57dfe5324942bf050","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-geocoder/-/hubot-geocoder-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"atehrani21","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/hubot-geocoder-1.0.1.tgz_1494529961330_0.13357094395905733"}},"1.0.2":{"name":"hubot-geocoder","version":"1.0.2","description":"A geocoder for hubot that utilizes the Google Maps API to return position coordinates based on a user inputted address.","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder.git"},"keywords":["hubot","geocode","slack","hubot-scripts"],"author":{"name":"Andrew Tehrani","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com","url":"http://andrewtehrani.com"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder#readme","dependencies":{"needle":"^1.6.0"},"gitHead":"4bc4693304b58f9f236a66fe9c59b9b16f0856b4","_id":"hubot-geocoder@1.0.2","_shasum":"3f2e72329d4a132a6a0e78bc43db07e1850bf8b7","_from":".","_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_nodeVersion":"6.9.5","_npmUser":{"name":"atehrani21","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"3f2e72329d4a132a6a0e78bc43db07e1850bf8b7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-geocoder/-/hubot-geocoder-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"atehrani21","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/hubot-geocoder-1.0.2.tgz_1494540705931_0.983417832525447"}}},"homepage":"https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder#readme","keywords":["hubot","geocode","slack","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder.git"},"author":{"name":"Andrew Tehrani","email":"atehrani21@gmail.com","url":"http://andrewtehrani.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atehrani21/hubot-geocoder/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
