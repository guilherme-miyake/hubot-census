Hubot Nextbus (Nashville)\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-nextbus.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-nextbus) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus.png)](https://travis-ci.org/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus)\n\nThis Hubot package is a Nashville, Tennessee MTA bus tracker. You provide an API key and a latitude and longitude for it to obtain the next expect bus to a particular set of nearby stops.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe first step is to get an API key for this service. As it is currently in a private beta, you'll have to [ask the creator nicely](https://nextbus.jt2k.com/about). He's a swell guy.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn your hubot repository, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-nextbus --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-nextbus** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-nextbus\"]\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe script has two environment variables.\n\n- `HUBOT_NEXTBUS_API_KEY` - Key provided by API creator. See note above.\n- `HUBOT_NEXTBUS_LAT_LON` - Default location for `hubot nextbus`, separated by a comma. (e.g. `36.1629191,-86.7813481`)\n\n### Heroku\n\n```bash\nheroku config:set HUBOT_NEXTBUS_API_KEY=ABCDEFG12345\nheroku config:set HUBOT_NEXTBUS_LAT_LON=36.1629191,-86.7813481\n```\n\n### Standard\n\n```\nexport HUBOT_NEXTBUS_API_KEY=ABCDEFG12345\nexport HUBOT_NEXTBUS_LAT_LON=36.1629191,-86.7813481\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### `hubot nextbus`\n\nReturns the next bus for the nearest stop.\n\n```\nuser> hubot nextbus\nhubot> Next bus arrives to 5TH AVE N & THE ARCADE NB at 9:45:38 pm (#61 - GULCH - GREEN CIRCUIT)\n```\n\n### `hubot nextbus stops`\n\nGet the list of stops nearby your configured latitude and longitude.\n\n```\nuser> hubot nextbus stops\nhubot> List of nearby stops:\nhubot> - 6AVCHUSN - 6TH AVE N & CHURCH ST SB / (Served by: #3 - WHITE BRIDGE, [...])\nhubot> - 5AUNISM - 5TH AVE & THE ARCADE SB / (Served by: #1 - 100 OAKS MALL)\nhubot> - 5AVCHUNM - 5TH AVE N & THE ARCADE NB / (Served by: #1 - DOWNTOWN, [...])\nhubot> - 5AVCHUNN - 5TH AVE N & CHURCH ST NB / (Served by: #1 - DOWNTOWN, [...])\nhubot> - UNI6AWN - UNION ST & 6TH AVE N WB / (Served by: #33 - DOWNTOWN, [...])\n```\n\n### `hubot nextbus stop <stop id>`\n\nReturns the next bus for a given stop ID.\n\n```\nuser> hubot nextbus stop 5AVCHUNM\nhubot> Next bus arrives to 5TH AVE N & THE ARCADE NB at 9:45:38 pm (#61 - GULCH - GREEN CIRCUIT)\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-10-11T21:14:24.283Z","created":"2015-06-08T03:02:47.038Z","0.0.1":"2015-06-08T03:02:47.038Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-08T03:20:20.734Z","0.1.1":"2016-12-13T04:27:54.137Z","0.1.2":"2017-01-07T21:50:42.482Z","0.1.3":"2017-10-11T21:14:24.283Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","nextbus","bus","nashville"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Yeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
