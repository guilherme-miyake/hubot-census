We also output emoji as `:click:`, `:credit:`, `:mu:`,\n`:links:`, `:trash:`, `:recurringcredit:`, and `:subroutine:`.

(`id`\nand `breaker` are supported as shorthand for `identity` and\n`icebreaker`.)\n\nIf you have `hubot-alias` installed, we tap into its list of aliases as well.\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot nrdb jackson howard\nhubot>> http://netrunnerdb.com/bundles/netrunnerdbcards/images/cards/en/04015.png\nuser2>> hubot nrtx noise\nhubot>> *Noise: Hacker Extraordinaire*\nIdentity: G-Mod\nLink: 0 • Deck: 45 • Influence: 15\n> Whenever you install a *virus* program, the Corp trashes the top card of R&D.\n_\"Watch this.
