Useful for a wide range of troubleshooting.\n\n## Optional Dependencies:\n - hubot-auth - Required to specify role for shell users. Defaults to allow anyone shell access. This is an obvious security risk so its recommended you use [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth) and specify a role for shell access with `SHELL_ROLE`. As an alternative, at least restrict shell actions to a peer reviewed chat room by defining `SHELL_ROOM`.\n\n## Configuration:\n - SHELL_ROLE - Role authorized to execute shell commands from hubot. Requires hubot-auth\n - SHELL_ROOM - Limit shell commands to a specific room. Useful to peer review of actions\n\n## Commands:\n - hubot shell <command> - Executes a subprocess and sends stdout upon completion. Waits for command to complete before responding.\n - hubot spawn shell <command> -  Spawns a subprocess and streams stdout back to chat. Useful for viewing stdout in real-time.\n\n## Usage:\n\n```bash\njustmiles> shell ping 8.8.8.8 -c 3\n\nhubot> PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=43 time=8.22 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=43 time=8.12 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=43 time=8.27 ms\n\n--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2010ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 8.129/8.212/8.278/0.062 ms\n\n\njustmiles> spawn ping 8.8.8.8 -c 4\n\nhubot> PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.\n\nhubot> 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=43 time=7.31 ms\n\nhubot> 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=43 time=9.50 ms\n\nhubot> 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=43 time=14.0 ms\n\nhubot> 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=43 time=7.27 ms\n\nhubot> --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---\n    4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3011ms\n    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.276/9.526/14.015/2.744 ms\n```","versions":{"1.0.1":{"name":"hubot-shell","version":"1.0.1","description":"Execute shell commands with your hubot.","main":"index.coffee","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"keywords":["hubot","shell","hubot-shell"],"author":{"name":"justMiles"},"license":"MIT","gitHead":"fe5c4d7acce8e3946c9ec4b286b10947a2a30e46","_id":"hubot-shell@1.0.1","_shasum":"b894baeeec76013b38b3246fc859f1fc8a643f2b","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.11.2","_nodeVersion":"0.12.6","_npmUser":{"name":"justmiles","email":"j.milesmaddox@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"justmiles","email":"j.milesmaddox@gmail.com"}],"dist":{"shasum":"b894baeeec76013b38b3246fc859f1fc8a643f2b","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-shell/-/hubot-shell-1.0.1.tgz"},"directories":{}},"1.0.2":{"name":"hubot-shell","version":"1.0.2","description":"Execute shell commands with your hubot.","main":"index.coffee","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"keywords":["hubot","shell","hubot-shell"],"author":{"name":"justMiles"},"license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/justmiles/hubot-shell.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/justmiles/hubot-shell/issues"},"gitHead":"b4d5da3df6b3f08a0497c2fad3f5f0b9bd1a88c2","homepage":"https://github.com/justmiles/hubot-shell#readme","_id":"hubot-shell@1.0.2","_shasum":"c52795dad3e4d2e1d37c3cab4838dbf7b348695c","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.11.2","_nodeVersion":"0.12.6","_npmUser":{"name":"justmiles","email":"j.milesmaddox@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"justmiles","email":"j.milesmaddox@gmail.com"}],"dist":{"shasum":"c52795dad3e4d2e1d37c3cab4838dbf7b348695c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-shell/-/hubot-shell-1.0.2.tgz"},"directories":{}}},"keywords":["hubot","shell","hubot-shell"],"author":{"name":"justMiles"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/justmiles/hubot-shell#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/justmiles/hubot-shell.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/justmiles/hubot-shell/issues"},"_attachments":{}}
