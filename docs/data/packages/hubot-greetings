Add `hubot-greetings` to your `package.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   \"dependencies\": {\n     \"hubot-greetings\": \"~1.0.0\"\n  },\n   ```\n2. Require the module in `external-scripts.json`:\n\n  ```json\n  [\"hubot-greetings\"]\n  ```\n3. Run `npm update` and restart your Hubot.\n\n## Commands\n\nTo tell Hubot to greet you with a specific phrase, tell him:\n\n```irc\nHubot: greet me with your hovercraft is full of eels!\n```\n\nHubot will remember *all* of the greetings that you've told him, and choose one randomly each time you enter the room. If you want him to stop using one of them, use:\n\n```irc\nHubot: don't greet me with the worst. really, just the worst\n```\n\nYou can wipe the slate clean with:\n\n```irc\nHubot: forget my greetings\n```\n\nIt's a bit spammy, but you can ask Hubot to list all of the greetings that he knows with:\n\n```irc\nHubot: show my greetings\n```\n\nReplace `me` with `you` or another user's username to change other people's greetings, if you're allowed to do so. Possessive forms are also recognized, so `Hubot: show Kyle's greetings` will work for a user named `Kyle`.\n\n## Greetings Czar\n\nBy default, Hubot will only let you add and remove greetings from yourself. You can change this by either setting the environment variable `HUBOT_GREETINGS_FFA` to something nonempty, to make it a giant free-for-all. Alternately, if you're using the [auth script](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/scripts/auth.coffee), you can grant your inner circle the **\"greeting czar\"** role, and they and only they can change whatever greetings they like.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"smashwilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-02-28T21:23:48.873Z","created":"2014-02-28T21:23:48.873Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-28T21:23:48.873Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/smashwilson/hubot-greetings","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/smashwilson/hubot-greetings.git"},"author":{"name":"Ash Wilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/smashwilson/hubot-greetings/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"metagard":true,"bnb":true}}
