hubot-twitch\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch#info=devDependencies)\n\nA Hubot script for interacting with [Twitch.tv][twitch] API.\n\nSee [`src/twitch.coffee`](src/twitch.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Attention:** [Starting from the 8th of August 2016][kraken], including the `Client-ID` in the header of all API requests has become a requirement by [Twitch.tv][twitch]. It was previously an OPTIONAL configuration option. This is no longer the case.\n\nYou can obtain the `Client-ID` from the [Connections](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections) page in your settings. You can then set this in your Hubot environment using:\n\n```bash\nexport TWITCH_API_KEY=\"YOUR CLIENT ID HERE\"\n```\n\nIf you are already doing the above, you will have nothing to worry about.\n\n\n## Installation via NPM\n\n1. Install the __hubot-twitch__ module as a Hubot dependency by running:\n\n    ```\n    npm install --save hubot-twitch\n    ```\n\n2. Enable the module by adding the __hubot-twitch__ entry to your `external-scripts.json` file:\n\n    ```json\n    [\n        \"hubot-twitch\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. Run your bot and see below for available config / commands\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nVariable | Default | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n`TWITCH_API_KEY` | N/A | _(Required)_ To avoid any restrictions when using Twitch API, please [register your application](http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections) and set your application [client ID](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/authentication.md#developer-setup) using this config\n`TWITCH_MAX_RESULTS` | 5 | The maximum number of result(s) to return\n`TWITCH_STORAGE_KEY` | _twitch | The unique key used for persistence (storing/retrieving users' Twitch-related data from memory)\n\n\n## Commands\n\nCommand | Listener ID | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nhubot ttv follows | `twitch.follows` | Returns the 10 most recent live streams belonging to your followed channels (list populated from your linked Twitch user, see command below)\nhubot ttv link `user` | `twitch.link` | Link Twitch `user` to you\nhubot ttv featured | `twitch.featured` | Returns the first `TWITCH_MAX_RESULTS` (or 5) featured live streams\nhubot ttv game `category` | `twitch.game` | Returns the first `TWITCH_MAX_RESULTS` (or 5) live streams in a game `category` (case-sensitive)\nhubot ttv search `query` | `twitch.search` | Returns the first `TWITCH_MAX_RESULTS` (or 5) live streams matching the search `query`\nhubot ttv stream `name` | `twitch.stream` | Returns information about stream `name`\nhubot ttv top | `twitch.top` | Returns the top `TWITCH_MAX_RESULTS` (or 5) games sorted by the number of current viewers on Twitch, most popular first\n\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot ttv follows\nhubot>> Dendi is streaming \"<:::::[]=¤༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ FOR THE WATCH\" @ http://www.twitch.tv/dendi\nhubot>> Sing_sing is streaming \"newbie dota player\" @ http://www.twitch.tv/sing_sing\nhubot>> user1: 2 of your followed channels are currently streaming.\n```\n\n\n[twitch]: https://www.twitch.tv/\n[kraken]: https://blog.twitch.tv/client-id-required-for-kraken-api-calls-afbb8e95f843","maintainers":[{"name":"mrsaints","email":"ian@fyianlai.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-06T22:46:04.674Z","created":"2014-09-30T21:12:55.819Z","1.0.0":"2014-09-30T21:12:55.819Z","1.0.1":"2014-12-22T01:36:38.059Z","1.1.1":"2015-02-09T02:32:36.156Z","1.1.2":"2015-06-28T00:41:51.447Z","1.1.3":"2015-08-27T18:07:19.606Z","1.2.0":"2016-04-12T23:03:24.564Z","1.3.0":"2016-05-29T21:16:12.446Z","2.0.0":"2016-06-06T22:46:04.674Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","twitch","livestream"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch.git"},"contributors":"Karl Birch (https://github.com/mbwk)","author":{"name":"Ian Lai","email":"os@fyianlai.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-twitch/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"metagard":true},"_attachments":{}}
