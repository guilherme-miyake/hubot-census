Hubot Mute\n\nAllows channels to mute Hubot if quiet is required for whatever reasons. Hubot will not respond to any commands in a muted channel (other than `mute` commands).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexhouse/hubot-mute.png)](https://travis-ci.org/alexhouse/hubot-mute) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-mute.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-mute)\n\n## Usage\n\n* `hubot mute list` - List all individually muted channels\n* `hubot global mute` - Globally mute all channels\n* `hubot global unmute` - Globally unmute all channels (but keep individually muted)\n* `hubot mute {channel}` - Mute specific channel\n* `hubot unmute {channel}` - Unmute specific channel\n* `hubot unmute all (the things)` - Unmute all individually muted channels\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis script requires the env variable `HUBOT_MUTE_ROOM_PREFIX` to be set. This is used in determining how to respond to the channel.\nThis should **ALWAYS** be set - even if blank (i.e. hipchat)\n\nFor example, if you're on IRC or Slack you'll probably want this setting as `#`. Basecamp should be able to leave it as blank.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the package `\"hubot-mute\": \"*\"` as a dependency in your Hubot package.json file. Then add `\"hubot-mute\"` to the list in the `external-scripts.json` file.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"alexhouse","email":"housealexander@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-29T18:56:25.717Z","created":"2014-04-17T08:14:13.201Z","0.0.1":"2014-04-17T08:14:13.201Z","0.0.2":"2014-04-17T08:45:11.658Z","0.0.3":"2014-04-17T08:49:03.298Z","0.0.4":"2014-04-17T08:51:45.670Z","0.0.5":"2014-08-31T07:02:15.621Z","0.0.6":"2015-07-24T18:04:20.253Z","0.0.7":"2015-07-29T18:49:50.932Z","0.0.8":"2015-07-29T18:52:09.148Z","0.0.9":"2015-07-29T18:56:25.717Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-mute#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-mute.git"},"author":{"name":"Alex House","email":"housealexander@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-mute/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"metagard":true},"_attachments":{}}
