Status](https://travis-ci.org/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts)\n\nThis is Hubot VTR, a series of Hubot actions for making Hubot a Computer Network Defense badass. The goal of this project is to create a series of Hubot actions for OSINT collection, Network Forensics, System Forensics, Reverse Engineering and other Network Defense tasks.\n\nI gave a presentation about Hubot VTR at BSidesDFW. Check out my [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/sroberts/using-robots-to-fight-bad-guys).\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst things first you'll need [Node.js and NPM installed](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager), after that setting up [Hubot VTR using NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/hubot-vtr-scripts) is easy.\n\n1. ```npm install hubot-vtr-scripts```\n\n2. Add ```\"hubot-vtr-scripts\": \">= 1.0.7\"``` to the dependences list in your Hubot `package.json`.\n\n3. Add ```\"hubot-vtr-scripts\"``` into your `external-dependencies.json` script between the brackets.\n\n__You're done! Restart Hubot and you're good to go!__\n\n### Environment Variables\nCertain scripts require use of private APIs and these require API authentication keys. You set those as environment variables.\n\n* `MYWOT_API_KEY` - http://www.mywot.com/\n* `PIPL_API_KEY` - http://dev.pipl.com/\n* `SHODAN_API_KEY` - http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc\n* `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` - https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/\n* `GOOGLE_SAFEBROWSING_API_KEY` - https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/key_signup\n* `OPENDNS_KEY` - https://sgraph.opendns.com/tokens-view\n\nHow you set these up may vary on your deployment method and operating system. For most Linux/OSX systems, you would do something like this from the command line:\n\n`export MYWOT_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX`\n\nIf you're running your Hubot on Heroku, you would run this from your local command line where the Heroku tools are installed:\n\n`heroku config:add MYWOT_API_KEY='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'`\n\n\n### Community Scripts\n\nGetting the recommended community scripts necessary requires adding the following lines into ```hubot-scripts.json```:\n\n\t\"announce.coffee\",\n\t\"availability.coffee\",\n\t\"deadline.coffee\",\n\t\"http-info.coffee\",\n\t\"isup.coffee\",\n\t\"news.coffee\",\n\t\"pypi.coffee\",\n\t\"sms.coffee\",\n\t\"heroku-status.coffee\",\n\t\"ip.coffee\",\n\t\"reload.coffee\",\n\t\"update.coffee\",\n\t\"base36.coffee\",\n\t\"base58.coffee\",\n\t\"base64.coffee\"\n\n## VTR Scripts\n\n| Script | Description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| [Code Name Generator](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/code-name-generator.coffee) | Generates code names for being spooky\n| [Geolocate IP](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/geolocate-ip.coffee) | Identify the physical location of an IP address\n| [MyWOT](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/mywot.coffee) | Look up the reputation of a website\n| [Pipl](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/pipl.coffee) | Look up OSINT on a users email address\n| [Google Safebrowsing](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/google-safebrowsing.coffee) | Look up Safebrowsing status of a URL |\n| [Reputation Links](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/reputation-links.coffee) | Generate links for Robtext, IP/URLVoid, etc\n| [Reverse DNS](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/reverse-dns.coffee) | Get the urls associated with an IP address\n| [Shodan](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/shodan.coffee) | Search engine for server strings. |\n| [Short URL Expander](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/short-url-expander.coffee) | Take a shortened URL and find out where it redirects to. |\n| [VirusTotal](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/virustotal.coffee) | Hash, URLs, IP Addresses |\n| [Yara](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/yara.coffee) | Generates template for creating Yara rules. |\n| [OpenDNS](https://github.com/sroberts/hubot-vtr-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/opendns-umbrella.coffee) | Accesses the OpenDNS Investigation graph. |\n\n### Additional Optional Community Scripts\n\nThese scripts are not required, but you may find them useful for your team.
