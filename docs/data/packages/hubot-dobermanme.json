Hubot-scrips can currently pug you, corgi you, and kitten you, so this seemed like the only logical option for my next hubot-script. As of right now, most of the images are of a friend of mines doberman. I'm happy to add more to the array, if you have any images you would like to add contact me via Github or Twitter @kwandrews7 and send me a publicly hosted URL (I recommend Imgur for hosting).\n\nBy sending me any images, you are stating that you have the rights to said images and are granting me permissions to include them in the doberman me hubot-script.\n\nThanks and enjoy!\n\nAPI\n---\n\n* `hubot doberman me` - Responds with a random doberman image.\n* `hubot how many dobermans are there` - Responds with the current number of dobermans available.\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command \n\n    $ npm install hubot-dobermanme\n\nThen to make sure the dependencies are installed:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nTo enable the script, add a `hubot-dobermanme` entry to the `external-scripts.json`\nfile (you may need to create this file).\n\n    [\"hubot-dobermanme\"]\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 0.0.1\n\n* It's a doberman me hubot script. What more could you ask for?\n* It's also probably not as fancy as the other \"animal me\" scripts. But, we'll keep working it.\n\n### 1.0.0\n\n* It's been out awhile, why not 1.0? (Insert zoidberg meme here.)\n* Moved the dobermans.json file off of a personal server into the GitHub repo.\n* Added more dobermans.","maintainers":[{"name":"kwandrews7","email":"kwandrews7@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-09-26T21:25:29.088Z","created":"2016-03-10T17:50:52.433Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-10T17:50:52.433Z","1.0.0":"2016-09-26T21:25:29.088Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-dobermanme#readme","keywords":["doberman","dobermanme","hubot","hubot-dobermanme","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-dobermanme.git"},"author":{"name":"Kyle Andrews","email":"https://github.com/kwandrews7"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-dobermanme/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
