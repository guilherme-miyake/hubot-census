By addressing people with a gender-specific word you can subtly\nexclude those who don't self-identify as 'guys'.\n\nGetting Hubot (or the original Slackbot) to gently remind people they're using language\nthat can exclude, struck me as a nice way to encourage people to be more inclusive.\n\nIf you want a longer explanation, Jen√©e Desmond-Harris\n[wrote an article on this on Vox](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8761227/you-guys-sexism-language)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"joerayme","email":"joe@joeray.me"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-09-22T19:27:04.031Z","created":"2015-09-22T19:27:04.031Z","0.0.1":"2015-09-22T19:27:04.031Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/joerayme/hubot-guys#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/joerayme/hubot-guys.git"},"author":{"name":"Joe Ray","email":"joe@joeray.me"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joerayme/hubot-guys/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
