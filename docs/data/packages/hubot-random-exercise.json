Only for Slack!","readme":"# Hubot: hubot-random-exercise\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/briwa/hubot-random-exercise/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/briwa/hubot-random-exercise)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hubot-random-exercise.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-random-exercise)\n[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/briwa/hubot-random-exercise.svg?style=flat-square)](https://codecov.io/gh/briwa/hubot-random-exercise)\n\nSends out messages to users to do randomly picked exercise.\nInspired from [brandonshin/slackbot-workout](https://github.com/brandonshin/slackbot-workout), so props to them!\n\n**Only for Slack!** This uses specific features that is supported by [@slack/client](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-sdk).\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd **hubot-random-exercise** to your `package.json` file:\n\n```\nnpm install --save hubot-random-exercise\n```\n\nAdd **hubot-random-exercise** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-random-exercise\"]\n```\n\nRun `npm install`\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n### Default\nInvite the bot to a channel and start getting crazy.\n\n```\nuser1>> @hubot start exercise normal mode\nhubot>> Alright, it's on! Next exercise will commence in 28 minutes :muscle:\n```\n\nBot will post a message to the channel every 20-30 minutes in normal mode. \nThere are a few other modes available: fast (10-15 min), slow (45-60 min), and madness (1-5 min).\nA random exercise will be picked from the `exercises` list. Feel free to modify to make it your own.\nThe exercise will be assigned to one of the members in the channel, picked at random.\n\nAs scheduled, the message would be like this:\n```\nhubot>> Your turn to do alternating leg lunges for 60 seconds today, @user1!\nhubot>> The next exercise will commence in 24 minutes :muscle:\n```\n\nAnd then it goes on and on, until all members have been picked.\n\nIf you want to stop the exercise prematurely, do so with:\n```\nuser1>> @hubot stop exercise\nhubot>> @user1 Exercise has been stopped! Thank you for doing the exercise :muscle:\n```\n\n### Single exercise\nAlternatively, you can do a single exercise for yourself:\n\n```\nuser1>> @hubot single exercise\nhubot>> Your turn to do alternating leg lunges for 60 seconds today, @user1!\n```\nThis will only generate one message only, as opposed to the default one.","versions":{"1.0.0":{"name":"hubot-random-exercise","description":"Sends out messages to users to do randomly picked
