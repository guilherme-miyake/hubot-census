[Hubot][hubot] framework and provides a download file functionality to the Rocket.Chat Hubot.\n\n\n### Configuration for DEV environment\nYou can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not\nbehave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely\nupon have been set.\n\nEnvironment variables to be set in the root folder:\n* export ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=''\n* export LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true\n* export RESPOND_TO_DM=true\n* export ROCKETCHAT_USER=[name of the bot]\n* export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=[password for the bot]\n* export ROCKETCHAT_URL= <URL HERE>\n* export NODE_VERSION=default\n\n(To learn more about environment variables and how they effect Hubot look at the Rocket.Chat Hubot github: https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat)\n\nNote this bot has already been modified to work specifically with Rocket Chat in the `./bin/hubot` file:\n\n`exec node_modules/.bin/hubot --name \"doge\" --adapter \"rocketchat\"`\n\nSince we have already set our adapter in the `./bin/hubot` file above, you can start doge by running the following command from the root folder:\n\n    % bin/hubot\n\nYou'll see some start up output and a prompt:\n\n    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379\n    doge>\n\nThen you can interact with doge by typing `@doge help`.\n\n    To get more specific information regarding which feature of the `@doge` bot you are having trouble with please run one of the following commands:\n\n    `@doge help cal` : help with the calendar bot\n\n### Commands\n\n* Calendar Suggestion Bot\n  * `@doge cal setup` : starts the setup wizard to get users up and running with the cal bot.\n  * `@doge cal suggest` : provides available meeting suggestions for today.\n  * `@doge cal suggest week` : provides available meeting suggestions for this week.\n  * `@doge cal suggest <month> <day>` : provides available meeting suggestions for the specified day.\n  * `@doge cal suggest week <month> <day>` : provides available meeting suggestions for that week starting on the specified day.\n  * `@doge cal suggest <users>` : provides available meeting suggestions for all included users, today.\n  * `@doge cal suggest <users> <month> <day>` : provides available meeting suggestions for all included users on the specified day.\n  * `@doge cal suggest <users> week` : provides available meeting suggestions for all included users on that week.\n  * `@doge cal suggest <users> week <month> <day>` : provides available meeting suggestions for all included users for that week, starting on the specified day.\n\n### pre-existing hubot-scripts\n\nThere are some added hubot-scripts that already came with Hubot.\n\nBefore hubot plugin packages were adopted, most plugins were held in the\n[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] package. Some of these plugins have yet to be\nmigrated to their own packages. They can still be used but the setup is a bit\ndifferent.\n\nTo enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with\nextension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this\nrepo.\n\n[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts\n\n##  Persistence\n\nIf you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested),\nyou will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified\naccount or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually\nset the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.\n\n    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL=\"...\"\n\nIf you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`\nfrom `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.\n\n[redistogo]: https://redistogo.com/\n\n## Adapters\n\nAdapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on, such\nas Campfire, Slack or IRC. There are a number of third party adapters that the\ncommunity have contributed. Check [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the\navailable ones.\n\nIf you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add\nthe adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the\n`dependencies` section.\n\nOnce you've added the dependency with `npm install --save` to install it and edited the `./bin/hubot` file (see above) you\ncan then run hubot with the adapter.\n\n    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>\n\nWhere `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## Deployment\n\n    % heroku create --stack cedar\n    % git push heroku master\n\nIf your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable\nand add the Redis to Go addon to your app.\n\n    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano\n\nIf you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].\n\nYou'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.\n\nMore detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto\nHeroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.\n\n### Deploying to UNIX or Windows\n\nIf you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.\nPlease check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and [deploying\nhubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.\n\n[heroku-node-docs]: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js\n[deploy-heroku]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md\n[deploy-unix]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md\n[deploy-windows]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/windows.md\n\n## Campfire Variables\n\nIf you are using the Campfire adapter you will need to set some environment\nvariables. If not, refer to your adapter documentation for how to configure it,\nlinks to the adapters can be found on [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters].\n\nCreate a separate Campfire user for your bot and get their token from the web\nUI.\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=\"...\"\n\nGet the numeric IDs of the rooms you want the bot to join, comma delimited. If\nyou want the bot to connect to `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/42`\nand `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/1024` then you'd add it like\nthis:\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS=\"42,1024\"\n\nAdd the subdomain hubot should connect to. If you web URL looks like\n`http://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com` then you'd add it like this:\n\n    % heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=\"mysubdomain\"\n\n[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md\n\n## More information on Hubot:\n\n[hubot]: http://hubot.github.com\n[generator-hubot]: https://github.com/github/generator-hubot\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
