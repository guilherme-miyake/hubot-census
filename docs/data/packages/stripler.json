Hubot Example\n\nAn example script package for Hubot\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-scripts/hubot-example.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-scripts/hubot-example)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nUsing the common directory structure for hubot script packages it will be easy\nto manage and allow others to easily contribute to your package.\n\n### script\n\nThis directory is home to a couple of development scripts; `bootstrap` and `test`\nthey're used to bootstrap the development environment and run tests\nrespectively.\n\n### src\n\nThis directory is home to the actual hubot scripts in the package. Your\n`index.coffee` entry point will load the scripts from this directory.\n\n### test\n\nThis directory is home to any tests you write for your scripts. This example\npackage uses Mocha, Chai and Sinon to manage writing tests.\n\n## Advantages of Building a Package\n\nSome of the advantages of building an npm package for your hubot script(s) are:\n\n* You don't need to rely on when hubot-scripts package is released.\n* You can specify dependencies in the `package.json` rather than have users\n  manually specify them\n* You can easily add tests using your favourite frameworks and libraries\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jakswa","email":"jakswa@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-09T04:13:59.856Z","created":"2014-08-08T23:47:33.147Z","0.0.1":"2014-08-08T23:47:34.563Z","0.0.2":"2014-08-09T00:18:29.816Z","0.0.3":"2014-08-09T01:14:04.493Z","0.0.4":"2014-08-09T01:57:26.787Z","0.0.5":"2014-08-09T03:02:47.205Z","0.0.6":"2014-08-09T03:50:23.798Z","0.0.7":"2014-08-09T04:11:09.866Z","0.0.8":"2014-08-09T04:13:59.856Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/jakswa/stripler","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jakswa/stripler.git"},"author":{"name":"Jake Swanson","email":"jakswa@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jakswa/stripler/issues"},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{}}
