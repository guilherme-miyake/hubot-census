Put a hashmap of your team members into it (key - display name (for ex. from slack/flowdock); value - login on Github):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Maciek\": \"mjurczyk\",\n  \"SomeOtherGuy: \"otherGuy\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd remember to put the filename in a proper environment variable after that:\n\n```shell\nexport HUBOT_ASSIGN_TEAM=./best-team-evr.json\n```\n\n### Github auth\n\nIf you would like hubot to post assignments directly to the pull requests on Github, export Basic Auth hash as a variable as well:\n\n```shell\nexport HUBOT_GITHUB_AUTH=\"Basic YOUR_AUTH_HASH\"\n```\n\n### Calling the assignment\n\nTo ask for assignment, just give hubot the PR URL:\n\n```\nyou > hubot: https://github.com/mjurczyk/hubot-assign-pr/pull/10\nhubot > Assigned PR to @mjurczyk and @anotherGuy. Review the hell outta it!\n```\n\nFollowed by that, hubot uses Github API and attempts to add proper comments to the pull request (requires Basic Auth).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mjurczyk","email":"thelairmail@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-10-12T08:10:28.019Z","created":"2015-10-05T05:55:26.253Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-05T05:55:26.253Z","0.1.1":"2015-10-12T08:10:28.019Z"},"keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
