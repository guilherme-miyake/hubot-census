This led him to idly invent an extreme sport called \"hammersport\". In his words:\n\n> \"Two combatants enter the chalk circle, bound together at the wrist. In each of their other hands is a claw hammer. It's over when there's a winner.\"\n\nSo, naturally, we made a mini role-playing game out of it. And, naturally, I'm porting it to Hubot.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"smashwilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-03-12T17:41:55.462Z","created":"2016-03-12T17:41:55.462Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-12T17:41:55.462Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/smashwilson/hubot-hammersport#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/smashwilson/hubot-hammersport.git"},"author":{"name":"Ash Wilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/smashwilson/hubot-hammersport/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
