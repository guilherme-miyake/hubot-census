hubot-axosoft\r\n\r\n![Hubot Logo](http://i.imgur.com/pp7scrv.png)\r\n\r\nA [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) script that helps you quickly grab data from and add new items to [Axosoft, an agile project management tool](http://www.axosoft.com). \r\n\r\nWorks both in the command line and hubot chat integrations. Tested with:\r\n* [Slack](http://www.slack.com)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYou will need an existing [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) installation as well as [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIn your hubot directory, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install hubot-axosoft --save\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow add **hubot-axosoft** to your `external-scripts.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\"hubot-axosoft\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will probably need to restart your hubot after doing this. You should now be ready to start using commands wherever you normally interact with hubot.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nBefore doing anything else you'll need to authenticate the app with your Axosoft account.\r\n\r\n1. Run `hubot axosoft set url youraxosofturl.axosoft.com`.\r\n2. Run `hubot axosoft authenticate` and you'll be given a link. Please open this in your browser.\r\n3. You'll now be asked to give hubot-axosoft read and write access to your account, after which you'll get redirected to a page displaying an authentication token (this can take a minute or two).\r\n4. Run `hubot axosoft set token TOKEN-GOES-HERE` to save the token.\r\n5. Finally, run `hubot axosoft setup` and hubot will do some behind-the-scenes setup, such as grabbing a list of your projects and retrieving your item type names. **Tip:** You can re-run this at any time to get fresh data.\r\n\r\nOnto the good stuff!\r\n\r\n## Available interactions\r\n\r\n### Work log report\r\n```\r\nhubot axosoft work logs from DAY\r\n```\r\n\r\nLists work logs submitted on the given day, grouped by user and item. Useful for standups/etc. and generally seeing what your team is up to.\r\n\r\nExample usage & supported parameters:\r\n```\r\nhubot axosoft work logs from today\r\nhubot axosoft work logs from yesterday\r\nhubot axosoft work logs from monday\r\nhubot axosoft work logs from 2015-01-13\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nWork logs from 2015-01-13:\r\nTyler Crammond:\r\n[1234] Make everything awesome - 0.5hr\r\nTotal: 0.5hr\r\n\r\nJames Martin:\r\n[55] Clean up Tyler's code - 1.23hr\r\nTotal: 1.23hr\r\n\r\nGrand total: 1.73hr\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Find feature by ID\r\n```\r\nhubot axosoft feature ID\r\n```\r\nReturns some information about the bug with the given ID. If you use a different name for features you should use that name instead.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\nImplement new home page design\r\nProject: Awesome Web App\r\nDescription:\r\nImplement Chris' new design for our home page.\r\nURL: https://myurl.axosoft.com/viewitem.aspx?id=99&type=features\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Add new feature\r\n```\r\nhubot add feature \"TITLE\" to PROJECT\r\n```\r\nAdds a new feature to the specified project. If you use a different name for features you should use that name instead.\r\nNote that your title must be in quotes. \r\n\r\n### Find bug by ID\r\n```\r\nhubot axosoft bug ID\r\n```\r\nReturns some information about the bug with the given ID. If you use a different name for bugs you should use that name instead.\r\n\r\n### Add new bug\r\n```\r\nhubot add bug \"TITLE\" to PROJECT\r\n```\r\nAdds a new bug to the specified project. If you use a different name for bugs you should use that name instead.\r\nNote that your title must be in quotes. \r\n\r\n### Find ticket by ID\r\n```\r\nhubot axosoft ticket ID\r\n```\r\nReturns some information about the bug with the given ID. If you use a different name for tickets you should use that name instead.\r\n\r\n### Add new ticket\r\n```\r\nhubot add ticket \"TITLE\" to PROJECT\r\n```\r\nAdds a new ticket to the specified project. If you use a different name for tickets you should use that name instead.\r\nNote that your title must be in quotes. \r\n\r\n#### Misc.\r\nLicense: MIT\r\n\r\nAll trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"tcrammond","email":"tyler@podpea.co.uk"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-05-21T07:24:09.840Z","created":"2015-04-30T22:46:14.320Z","0.1.0":"2015-04-30T22:46:14.320Z","0.1.1":"2015-05-01T11:47:39.836Z","0.1.2":"2015-05-04T20:06:46.301Z","0.1.3":"2015-05-05T11:38:40.800Z","0.1.4":"2015-05-05T11:45:38.282Z","0.2.0":"2015-05-07T19:16:27.841Z","0.2.1":"2015-05-07T19:51:59.450Z","0.2.2":"2015-05-07T19:56:51.915Z","0.2.3":"2015-05-07T20:32:41.180Z","0.2.4":"2015-05-07T20:52:58.020Z","0.2.5":"2015-05-13T17:28:24.964Z","0.2.6":"2015-05-17T20:42:54.398Z","0.2.7":"2015-05-19T18:07:58.974Z","0.2.8":"2015-05-19T18:36:39.832Z","0.2.9":"2015-05-21T07:07:32.766Z","0.2.10":"2015-05-21T07:22:06.400Z","0.2.11":"2015-05-21T07:24:09.840Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tcrammond/hubot-axosoft","keywords":["hubot","axosoft","ontime","agile","standup","stand up"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/tcrammond/hubot-axosoft.git"},"author":{"name":"Tyler Crammond","email":"@TylerCrammond"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tcrammond/hubot-axosoft/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
