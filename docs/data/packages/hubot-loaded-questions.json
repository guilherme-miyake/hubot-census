Loaded Questions, the game where guessing the answers gets you in just as much trouble as giving your own.\n\n## The Game\nLoosely based on the hit board game by Freshly Completed, http://freshlycompleted.blogspot.com/2013/11/loaded-questions-free-printable-game.html\n\nA typical game of Loaded Questions follows these steps:\n* Someone types `!loadquestion` in the Loaded Questions room.\n```asciidoc\n[hubot APP] *NEW ROUND STARTED!!!*\n\nThe current question is: *\"If you could add one feature to your cell phone, what would it be?\"*\nYou can submit your own answer by sending me a private message beginning with `submit answer`, followed by your answer\n```\n* Anyone who wants to play sends a PM to Hubot in the format `submit answer HERE IS WHERE MY ANSWER GOES!`\n* Once enough people have submitted answers (the default number is 5 people, see [Configuration](#configuration) below), a countdown begins (the default is 5 minutesâ€”again, see [Configuration](#configuration)!) to end the round. Or, someone can say `!endquestion` to end the round early.\n* After the round is ended, Hubot will say:\n```asciidoc\n[hubot APP] *ROUND ENDED!!!* (due to timeout)\n\nThere were 6 answers submitted for _\"If you could add one feature to your cell phone, what would it be?\"_:\n> *1.* a pez dispenser\n> *2.* send schedule text messages to my parents\n> *3.* A \"receive call\" feature would be sweet. :(\n> *4.* lead into gold\n> *5.* a spray bottle\n> *6.* curing diseases for a nominal fee (paid directly to me)\n\n\nPlayers whose answers haven't been guessed: *user2*, *user1*, *user6*, *user4*, *user5*, *user3*.\nTo guess who submitted an answer, say `!guessanswer [number] [username]`.\n```\n* Users can then optionally guess who submitted each answer by saying `!guessanswer` or `!ga` followed by their guess.\n* As each answer is guessed, Hubot will let you know if you guessed correctly or incorrectly. You can re-print the answers list to see which answers have been guessed so far (or because the list has scrolled way off the screen) by saying `!printanswers`.\n* Once all the answers are guessed, Hubot will wait patiently for the next round!\n\nAfter playing for a while, you can see stats for the game by saying `!lqstats`, or stats for individual players by saying `!lqstats [username]`.\n\n## Configuration\nLoaded Questions has these configurable values:\n* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_ROOM` - which channel name or ID to post messages to (this game can be a little spammy, so it's best to have a dedicated room). Default is #random.\n* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_QUORUM` - how many answers to wait for before triggering a countdown to end the round. Default is 5.\n* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_SKIPNUM` - how many users must agree to skip a question before it is skipped. Default is 2.\n* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_TIMEOUT` - how many minutes to wait during the countdown before the round ends. Default is 5.\n\nLoaded Questions also comes with a default set of 275 questions, and more can be added if your friends have some good ones by creating a `loaded_questions.json` file in the `res/` directory at the root of your Hubot project. Here's an example of what that might look like:\n```json\n// hubot/res/loaded_questions.json\n[\n    \"Ding dong! Who's there?\",\n    \"Doctors hate him! What did he do?\",\n    \"Excuse me, how do I get to the nearest gas station?\"\n]\n```\n\nLoaded Questions will find those extra questions and add 'em to the mix.\n\n## Commands\n* `!loadquestion` - (public only) starts a new question, if there isn't one currently.\n* `!printquestion` - (public or pm) prints the current question.\n* `!skipquestion` - (public only) votes to skips the current question and load a new one.\n* `!endquestion` - (public only) ends the round of questioning and displays the answers.\n* `!printanswers` - (public or pm) prints the answers that were given during the round.\n* `!guessanswer [number] [user]` - (public only) guess that answer `number` was submitted by `user`. You can shortcut this command with `!ga [number] [user]`.\n* `submit answer [answer]` - (pm only) submits your answer to the question.\n* `!lqstats [username]` - (public or pm) shows some stats about the game. Optionally include a username to see stats for that specific user.\n\nUses hubot brain to keep track of the game state and some stats.\n\n## Add it to your hubot!\n\nRun the following command\n\n    $ npm install hubot-loaded-questions --save\n\nThen add `hubot-loaded-questions` to the `external-scripts.json` file (you may need to create this file).\n\n    [\"hubot-loaded-questions\"]\n\n\n## Issues\nIf you find a bug, please let me know about it at https://github.com/perrygoy/hubot-loaded-questions/issues. This module was exclusively tested on Slack, so i'm not sure how it behaves on other chat clients.\n\nThanks\n------\nI've had a ton of fun creating this module and playing it with my friends, and i want it to be a great time for everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read this README, and i hope you have a great time playing Loaded Questions!\n","maintainers":[{"name":"perrygoy","email":"perry.goy@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-23T02:05:44.256Z","created":"2018-01-23T01:58:47.694Z","1.0.0":"2018-01-23T01:58:47.694Z","1.0.1":"2018-01-23T02:02:27.244Z","1.0.2":"2018-01-23T02:05:44.256Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/perrygoy/hubot-loaded-questions#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","loaded","questions","game"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/perrygoy/hubot-loaded-questions.git"},"author":{"name":"Perry Goy","email":"perry.goy@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/perrygoy/hubot-loaded-questions/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
