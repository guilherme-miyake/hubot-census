It is just a background task that makes consuming Github webhooks easier for other scripts.\n\nFor another example, see our [Hubot-Github adapter](https://github.com/ynab/hubot-github) that gives you a hubot in your Github issue comments.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI was using [hubot-github-repo-event-notifier](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-github-repo-event-notifier), but I needed something more generic to power our hubot-github adapter. So, I gutted it, and this script was born.\n\n## Local Testing\n\nFor easy local testing, I highly recommend ngrok: https://ngrok.com/\n\n1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)\n2. run ngrok: `ngrok 8080`.\n  It will show you a public URL like: `Forwarding  https://7a008da9.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:8080`\n3. Put that URL in as your Github webhook: `https://7a008da9.ngrok.com/hubot/github-repo-listener`\n4. Run hubot locally: `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=some_log_guid bin/hubot -a github --name Hubot`\n5. Fire off a github event by interacting with your repo. Comment on an issue or a PR for example.\n6. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`\n  There you can see all webhooks posted to your local machine, and can replay them as many times as you wish.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; [YouNeedABudget.com](http://youneedabudget.com), LLC.
