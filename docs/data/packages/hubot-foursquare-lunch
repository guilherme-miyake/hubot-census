Register a Foursquare application to obtain your `FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID` and `FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET`\n2. Authenticate either your personal foursquare account or a purpose-specific user that acts as your bot\n3. Manually walk through the OAuth process to obtain a `FOURSQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (this can be tricky)\n\nWhen you have all three values, load them as environment variables for launching your Hubot. If you are installing via Heroku, you would enter:\n\n```\n$ heroku set:config FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid\n$ heroku set:config FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret\n$ heroku set:config FOURSQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=youraccesstoken\n$ heroku set:config HUBOT_DEFAULT_LATITUDE=yourcoordinates\n$ heroku set:config HUBOT_DEFAULT_LONGITUDE=yourcoordinates\n```\n\nIf you are using some other hosting/launcher, make sure the variables above are loaded in appropriately.\n\n## Adding Module to Your Hubot\n\nSee full instructions [here](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#npm-packages).\n\n1. `npm install hubot-foursquare-lunch --save` (updates your `package.json` file)\n2. Open the `external-scripts.json` file in the root directory (you may need to create this file) and add an entry to the array (e.g. `[ 'hubot-foursquare-lunch' ]`).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Get All Recent Checkins\n\n* `hubot lunch`\n* Returns a random nearby lunch spot\n","maintainers":[{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-12-29T18:06:32.966Z","created":"2015-07-22T20:52:58.457Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-22T20:52:58.457Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-29T18:06:32.966Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-foursquare-lunch","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","foursquare","lunch"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-foursquare-lunch.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Yeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-foursquare-lunch/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
