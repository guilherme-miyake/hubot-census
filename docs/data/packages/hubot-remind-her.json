It simply DWYM (Does what you mean) without\n  expecting much grammar.\n* Uses friendly relative date in the confirmation message.\n* Recurrent reminders.\n* Listing and deleteing existing reminders.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the npm package\n\n    npm install hubot-remind-her --save\n\nand add *hubot-remind-her* to `external-scripts.json`\n\n    [ \"hubot-remind-her\" ]\n\nNote: This script will not work in conjuction with [remind.coffee][] and\n[hubot-remind-at][], so disable them if you are enabling this.\n\nRemember to set your timezone correctly. For example, on heroku you need to run\n`heroku config:set TZ=\"foo\"`\n\n## Usage\n\nIf it is prefixed with `remind`, and ends with `to <something>`, and\nhas a date in between, it'll work.\n\n```\n> hubot remind me in every 10 minutes to have fun\n> hubot remind me tomorrow 10 PM to eat\n> hubot remind me at 18 Feb to be alive\n> hubot remind me every Tuesday to watch pogo\n> hubot list reminders\n> hubot delete reminder 1\n```\n\nTo get detailed help about the sort of time strings supported, see the\n[chrono][] homepage.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe first time around, you'll need to install the necessary development\ndependencies required to run the tests:\n\n    npm install\n\nSubsequently, you can run the tests using:\n\n    npm test\n\n## History/Credits\n\nThis is a spiritual successor of the [remind.coffee][] and the\n[hubot-remind-at][] scripts, combining their functionality, making the\ncommand syntax more flexible, and the bot's responses more friendly.\nAll thanks to the awesomeness of [chrono][] and [moment.js][].\n\n## Bugs\n\n* Reminders longer that 24 days in the future are immediately\n  triggered ([Reference][long-settimeout]).\n\n[Hubot]: https://hubot.github.com/\n[remind.coffee]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/remind.coffee)\n[hubot-remind-at]: https://github.com/soh335/hubot-remind-at.git\n[chrono]: http://wanasit.github.io/pages/chrono/\n[long-settimeout]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12351521/can-settimeout-be-too-long\n[moment.js]: http://momentjs.com/\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mx4492","email":"mx4492@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-02-08T21:12:13.401Z","created":"2015-02-15T16:03:29.219Z","0.2.0":"2015-02-15T16:03:29.219Z","0.3.0":"2015-02-16T05:46:36.124Z","0.4.0":"2015-05-28T10:00:13.587Z","0.4.1":"2015-06-06T04:53:38.538Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mx4492/hubot-remind-her","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","reminder"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mx4492/hubot-remind-her.git"},"author":{"name":"Manav Rathi"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mx4492/hubot-remind-her/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"bnb":true,"vghhkjh":true}}
