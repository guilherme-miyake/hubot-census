The scores are persisted as a simple JSON file in the shared volume.\r\n\r\n## Setup:\r\n\r\nRun an `npm install` in the scripts directory to install dependencies.\r\n\r\nYou can use `dockerlocal.sh` to start up a local docker instance, just change the configuration settings in _dockerlocal.sh.example_.\r\n\r\n## Environment Variables:\r\n\r\n* **QUIZBOT_SCORES_FILE** - Location of the scores file within the docker container.\r\n* **QUIZBOT_QUESTIONS_FILE** - Location of the questions file within the docker container.\r\n* **QUIZBOT_BANG_COMMANDS** - Set to true if you would like to address quizbot using !scores, !ask, rather than 'quizbot scores', 'quizbot ask' and so on.\r\n* **QUIZBOT_FORFEIT_TIME** - Time (in seconds) before a question will automatically reveal the answer.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"kzf","email":"kzfray+npm@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-03-07T02:10:14.884Z","created":"2017-03-07T02:10:14.884Z","0.0.0":"2017-03-07T02:10:14.884Z"},"author":{"name":"kevinf@pronto.net"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
