a Rocket.Chat bot in under two minutes. \n\n### NB: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS\n\n> Please do not attempt to implement until this message is removed\n>\n> The `-develop` tag will also be removed from the package file.\n\n[hubot]: https://github.com/hubotio/hubot\n[hubot-rocketchat]: https://github.com/rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat\n[sdk]: https://github.com/rocketchat/Rocket.Chat.js.SDK\n[contributing]: https://rocket.chat/docs/contributing/developing/\n[issues]: https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate/issues\n[generator]: https://github.com/hubotio/generator-hubot\n[deployment]: https://hubot.github.com/docs/deploying/\n[dotenv]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\n[newrepo]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/\n[env]: https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat#configuring-your-bot\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate\ncd hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate\nnpm install\n```\nCreate a _.env_ file with content:\n\n```\nexport ROCKETCHAT_URL=myserver.com\nexport ROCKETCHAT_USER=mybotuser\nexport ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=mypassword\nexport ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=general\nexport ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=true\n```\n\nAdjust the content to fit your server and user credentials. Make sure `myuser` has **BOT role** on the server, if you don't know what that means, ask your server administrator to set it up for you.\n\nThen run the bot:\n\n```\nsource .env\nbin/hubot\n```\n\nOn the server, login as a regular user (not the BOT user), go to GENERAL, and try:\n\n```\nmybotuser what time is it\n```\n\nOR\n\n```\nmybotuser rc version\n```\n`< TBD:  insert sample run screenshot >`\n\nYou can examine the source code of these two bots under the `/scripts` directory, where you can add your own bot scripts written in Javascript.\n\n## Stable Versions\n\nThis demo uses [Hubot][hubot] v3 and [Rocketchat.Chat adapter][hubot-rocketchat]\nv2, using the new [Rocketchat Node.js SDK][[sdk] for Rocket.Chat instances\n0.60.0 onward.\n\nVersions of `hubot-rocketchat` prior to v2 are incompatible with Hubot v3\n\nDue to the v1 adapter's use of Coffeescript, extending classes in es6\njavascript is troublesome.\n\nThis bot is written in es6 and intended to run on node v8+. To run a bot on\nolder versions of node would require compiling with babel to use the full es6\nfeature set.\n\nOlder versions of the adaptor (v0.*) are also incompatible with more recent\nversions of Rocket.Chat (v0.35+). Please report an issue if you find specific \nversion mismatches and we'll update this document.\n\n## More Details\n\nThis is a boilerplate for making your own bots with Hubot and Rocket.Chat.\n\n### Running Locally\n\nYou can run with the shell adapter just to test\n\n1. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies\n2. Use the `yarn shell` script to start the bot with shell adaptor\n3. Say `hubot help` to see what it can do\n\nWhen you're ready to connect the bot to an instance of Rocket.Chat\n\n1. Create a user for the bot, with the role _bot_\n2. Create an `./.env` file with the user and connection settings\n3. Run `yarn local` script to connect to your local Rocket.Chat\n\nThe `local` npm script will read in the env file, so you can populate and modify\nthose settings easily (see [configuration](#configuration)). In production, they\nshould be pre-populated in the server environment.\n\n### Running in Production\n\nThere are executables for different environments that all run the Hubot binary.\n\nBefore running make sure your production environment has the required \nenvironment variables for the adapter, url, user, name and pass. Or you can add\nthem after the launch command as switches, like `-a rocketchat`.\n\n- `bin/hubot` unix binary\n- `bin/hubot.cmd` in windows\n- `Procfile` for Heroku\n\nEnv variables should be populated on the server before launching\n(see [configuration](#configuration)). The launcher will also install npm\ndependencies on every run, in case it's booting in a fresh container (this isn't\nrequired when working locally).\n\nMore information on [deployment configs][deployment] here.\n\n### Adding Scripts\n\nScripts can be added to the `./scripts` folder, or by installing node packages\nand listing their names in the `external-scripts.json` array. There's an example\nof each in this repo, but neither is required.\n\n### Example Scripts\n\nTwo scripts are packaged with the boilerplate, as a demo for manual tests.\nEach of the following will respond in a public channel if the bot username is\nprefixed, or without the bot's name if in a DM.\n\n- `what time is it` or `what's the time` - Tells you the time\n- `rc version` - Gives you version info for Rocket.Chat and Hubot (two messages)\n\n## Configuration\n\nWhen running locally, we've used [`dotenv`][dotenv] to load configs from the\n`./.env` file. That makes it easy for setting environment variables.\n\nPlease see [adapter docs for source of truth on environment variables][env].\n\n## Contributions Welcome\n\nPlease see [our documentation on contributing][contributing], then\n[visit the issues][issues] to share your needs or ideas.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
