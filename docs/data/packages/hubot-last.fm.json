Status](https://travis-ci.org/derekpeterson/hubot-last-fm.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/derekpeterson/hubot-last-fm)\r\n\r\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-last.fm.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/hubot-last.fm)\r\n\r\nThis is a Hubot plugin for keeping track of what team members are scrobbling to last.fm.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall `hubot-last.fm` as a dependency of your Hubot and add `\"hubot-last.fm\"` to your `external-scripts.json` list. Make sure that you have a [last.fm API key](http://www.last.fm/api/accounts) set as `HUBOT_LAST_FM_API_KEY` in your environment.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou can add users two ways:\r\n\r\nFirst (recommended, but optional), you can place a seed JSON file in `{{ project-root }}/data/last-fm-users.json` with an object mapping chat names to last.fm usernames. For example,\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"derek\": \"labetephoque\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, add new usernames in chat, using `add last.fm {{ user name }} {{ last.fm user name }}`. Keep in mind that this is only stored in memory, though, so it will go away if you restart your Hubot.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nI've only tested this in Slack, so it's possible that integrations with other chat clients won't work. If that's the case, let me know.\r\n\r\nOh, and I welcome requests for more features.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"derekpeterson","email":"derekpetey@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-13T20:11:22.517Z","created":"2015-01-03T08:21:55.921Z","0.1.0":"2015-01-03T08:21:55.921Z","0.1.1":"2015-01-03T08:28:07.279Z","0.1.3":"2015-01-03T10:52:09.226Z","0.1.4":"2015-01-07T01:03:01.376Z","0.2.0":"2015-01-09T06:57:00.188Z","0.2.1":"2015-01-09T07:03:41.937Z","0.3.0":"2015-01-13T20:11:22.517Z"},"keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","last.fm","plugin"],"author":{"name":"Derek Peterson","email":"derekpetey@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/derekpeterson/hubot-last-fm","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/derekpeterson/hubot-last-fm"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/derekpeterson/hubot-last-fm/issues"},"users":{"revi":true},"_attachments":{}}
