This particular module is built around the idea of subscribing/unsubscribing users _one particular email list_ and viewing the latest campaigns for _one particular client_.\n\nIt is heavily inspired (and borrows some code) from the [hubot-mailchimp](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-mailchimp) module.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn your hubot repository, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-createsend --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-createsend** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-createsend\"]\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe script has three environment variables.\n\n- `CREATESEND_API_KEY` - API key of account or particular client (recommended).\n- `CREATESEND_CLIENT_ID` - Unique identifier for desired client\n- `CREATESEND_LIST_ID` - Unique identifier for desired mailing list\n\n### Heroku\n\n```bash\nheroku config:set CREATESEND_API_KEY=<Acount/Client API Key>\nheroku config:set CREATESEND_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID>\nheroku config:set CREATESEND_LIST_ID=<List ID>\n```\n\n### Standard\n\n```\nexport CREATESEND_API_KEY=<Acount/Client API Key>\nexport CREATESEND_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID>\nexport CREATESEND_LIST_ID=<List ID>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### `hubot createsend`\n\nReturns the the statistics for the last sent campaign.\n\n```\nuser> hubot createsend\nhubot> Last campaign \"April 2015 Newsletter\" was sent to 4388 subscribers (902 opened, 306 clicked, 21 unsubscribed)\n```\n\n### `hubot createsend subscribe <email>`\n\nAdd an email address to the list.\n\n```\nuser> hubot createsend subscribe stephen@example.com\nhubot> Attempting to subscribe stephen@example.com...\nhubot> You successfully subscribed stephen@example.com.\n```\n\n### `hubot createsend unsubscribe <email>`\n\nRemove an email address from the list.\n\n```\nuser> hubot createsend unsubscribe stephen@example.com\nhubot> Attempting to unsubscribe stephen@example.com...\nhubot> You successfully unsubscribed stephen@example.com.\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-02-21T06:40:26.240Z","created":"2015-02-21T06:40:26.240Z","1.0.0":"2015-02-21T06:40:26.240Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenyeargub/hubot-createsend","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","campaign monitor","createsend"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/stephenyeargub/hubot-createsend.git"},"author":{"name":"stephenyeargin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-createsend/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
