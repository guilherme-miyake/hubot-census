[Hubot Discourse adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-discourse-adapter)\n\nA [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) adapter for [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/).\n\nA bot here will only be called in for topics it is notified for.\n\nTo get up and running, the adapter requires a few hubot variables to be set:\n* `HUBOT_DISCOURSE_USERNAME` the username the bot will connect as.\n* `HUBOT_DISCOURSE_KEY` the API key for the user. This needs to be a user API key, not a site-wide API key.\n* `HUBOT_DISCOURSE_SERVER` the discourse server eg `https://discourse.example.com/`.\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nnpm install -g yo generator-hubot\nmkdir my-awesome-hubot && cd my-awesome-hubot\nyo hubot --adapter=discourse-adapter\n```\n\n## Discourse configuration\n\nBy default, Discourse does not send users alert messages unless directly notified via `@username`, or by quoting.\n\nIn order to receive messages without a direct reply, you may either set the bot account's watched topics/categories to \"watched\" manually, or allow for \"opt-in notifications\".\n\nFor opt-in notifications, set the bot's user preferences, notifications and set `When I post in a topic, set that topic to` `Watching` After the first reply, Hubot will then listen for any post after its first reply.\n\n## Private Messages\n\nDiscourse adapter has a special mechanism to ensure a private reply to a post.\n\nIn a bot's config you can set the res.envelope.pm to ensure a reply goes through a PM to a user.\n\nSet the res.envelope.pm to true. If the message is already a PM, the bot will reply as normal. If the message is public, the bot will create a new PM and send it to the user.\n\n```\n  robot.hear /private hello/i, (res) ->\n    res.envelope.pm = true\n    res.send \"I will reply hello privately!\"\n```\n\n## Arbitrary room messaging\n\nThe Discourse adapter supports messaging rooms via `res.robot.messageRoom`. If given a comma separated list of strings, this will be a new PM. If the first argument is a topic id, this will create a new post in the specified topic.\n\n```\n  robot.hear /alert admins/i, (res) ->\n    res.robot.messageRoom \"admin1,admin2\", \"topic to give to two admins\", \"this is a post I want to give to admins\"\n```\n\n```\n  robot.hear /bump a post/i, (res) ->\n    res.robot.messageRoom 123, \"I am posting in another existing post\"\n```\n\n## Message info\n\nAfter \"hearing\" something, the returned Response object (`res`) contains the raw message, with a few extensions.\n\n`res.message.text` - the text of the message\n`res.message.title` - the topic title of the heard post\n`res.message.slug` - the URL of the heard post\n`res.message.pm` - a boolean to detect whether or not this message was sent as a PM.\n`res.envelope.user.username` - the username that sent the message to this bot.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jwong","email":"awole20@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-10-16T17:11:15.350Z","created":"2017-05-26T02:32:30.553Z","1.0.0":"2017-05-26T02:32:30.553Z","1.0.1":"2017-05-26T04:03:14.244Z","1.0.2":"2017-05-26T04:05:58.549Z","1.0.3":"2017-05-26T04:11:53.572Z","1.0.4":"2017-05-26T21:43:11.358Z","1.0.5":"2017-05-26T23:51:12.710Z","1.0.6":"2017-05-27T18:32:00.831Z","1.0.7":"2017-05-28T04:38:12.235Z","1.0.8":"2017-05-28T15:16:36.643Z","1.0.9":"2017-05-28T15:55:21.272Z","1.1.0":"2017-10-13T23:53:56.123Z","1.1.1":"2017-10-16T17:11:15.350Z"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["hubot","adapter","discourse"],"homepage":"https://github.com/featheredtoast/hubot-discourse-adapter"}
