hubot-search\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-search.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-search)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-search/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-search#info=devDependencies)\n\nAn extendable Hubot script for querying several search engine services: [Google Custom Search][googlesearch], [Azure Marketplace - Bing Search API v2][azurebing], and [Microsoft Cognitive Services - Bing Search API v5][cognitivebing].\n\nSee [`src/search.coffee`](src/search.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Attention:** Azure Marketplace _\"Bing Search\"_ and _\"Bing Search Web Results Only\"_ API (v2) [offerings][azurebing] will end of life on **December 15, 2016**.\n\nCurrently by default, this script will use [Azure Marketplace - Bing Search API v2][azurebing], and the `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY` environment variable should be the [v2 key][azurebingkey] (from Azure Marketplace).\n\nNevertheless, we strongly recommend that you use [Microsoft Cognitive Services - Bing Search API v5][cognitivebing] by setting `USE_BING_V5` to `true` in the environment that is using this script, and ensuring the `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY` is the [v5 key][cognitivebingkey] (from Cognitive Services).\n\n`USE_BING_V5` will not be necessary by 2017 when the v2 API is deprecated at end of life.\n\n\n## Installation via NPM\n\n1. Install the **hubot-search** module as a Hubot dependency by running:\n\n    ```\n    npm install --save hubot-search\n    ```\n\n2. Enable the module by adding the **hubot-search** entry to your `external-scripts.json` file:\n\n    ```json\n    [\n        \"hubot-search\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. Run your bot and see below for available config / commands\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nVariable | Default | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n`GOOGLE_API_KEY` | N/A | A unique developer [API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key) is required to use Google's Custom Search API\n`GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH` | N/A | The [Google Custom Search][googlesearch] engine [identifier](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) (the `cx` portion of the custom search engine URL)\n`BING_SEARCH_API_KEY` | N/A | The [API key][cognitivebingkey] for performing [Bing Search API][cognitivebing] queries\n`MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS` | 5 | The number of search results to return\n\n### [Google Custom Search][googlesearch]\n\nThe Google Custom Search command listener will not be registered if neither `GOOGLE_API_KEY` nor `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH` environment variables are defined.\n\n#### Create Google API Key\n\n1. Create a new API key: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials\n2. Select _\"Server key\"_ for the type. You may be required to create a new project, just follow the instructions\n3. Return to the _\"Overview\"_, and locate _\"Custom Search API\"_\n4. Enable _\"Custom Search API\"_\n\n#### Create Google Custom Search Engine\n\n1. Create a new Google Custom Search engine: https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new\n2. To search all websites, enter any web URL in (1), and complete the creation\n3. Edit your newly created search engine\n4. Set _\"Sites to search\"_ to _\"Search the entire web but emphasize included sites\"_, and delete the sites you have previously added\n5. Save, and export the variables:\n\n    ```bash\n    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"API KEY HERE\"\n    export GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH=\"ENGINE ID HERE\"\n    ```\n\n### [Azure Marketplace - Bing Search API v2][azurebing]\n\nThe Bing Search API command listener will not be registered if `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY` is not defined.\n\n1. Visit https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/searchweb\n2. Subscribe for a _\"Bing Search API – Web Results Only\"_ package / plan (free works fine)\n3. [Obtain][azurebingkey] the primary account key (located at the top of the page under _\"Show\"_)\n4. Export the API key:\n\n    ```bash\n    export BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=\"API KEY HERE\"\n    ```\n\n### [Microsoft Cognitive Services - Bing Search API v5][azurebing]\n\nThe Bing Search API command listener will not be registered if `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY` is not defined.\n\n1. Visit https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions?productId=/products/56ec2de6bca1df083495c610\n2. Subscribe for a _\"Bing Web Search\"_ package / plan (free works fine)\n3. [Obtain][cognitivebingkey] the API key (located in the _\"Keys\"_ column; click _\"Show\"_)\n4. Export the API key:\n\n    ```bash\n    export BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=\"API KEY HERE\"\n    export USE_BING_V5=\"true\"\n    ```\n\n\n## Commands\n\nCommand | Listener ID | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nhubot `<search|google>` `query` | `search.google` | Queries Google Custom Search for `query`, and returns the first `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS` results\nhubot bing `query` | `search.bing` | Queries Bing Search API for `query`, and returns the first `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS` results\n\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot search Elon Musk\nhubot>> 1.
